Fernando Miramez de Olivídeo was born in Spain and, as a young man, deepened 
in the history of the peoples and nations of the Earth showing great interest 
in the discovery of the Americas, falling in love with the lands of Santa Cruz.

In 1649 Miramez descends on the coast of Brazil. Barefoot your boots and step 
the ground, tears mares your eyes and fall into generous soil. At this moment 
Earth and Spirit made an exchange of energies and values, whose beneficial 
results would be observed through the ages.  

In a short time, indigenous and African dialects have spoken, catechizing and 
relieving physical and spiritual pain saches of humble brothers.

iramez is the spiritual guide of medium João Nunes Maia and guides him since 1958, 
when he first spoke during a meeting at the Spiritist Union of Minas Gerais, in 
Belo Horizonte. 

Fernando Olivídeo was Spanish and, in the service of the King of Spain, stepped on 
Brazilian lands never to leave. He donated all his possessions in his homeland 
and became protector of Indians and blacks, being called White Father.

The Spanish nobleman had great interest in the stories of the peoples and nations 
of the Earth. He was looking for information on the findings of Christopher Columbus 
and Pedro Álvares Cabral and, even without knowing them, he already felt affection 
for the Land of Santa Cruz. Intelligent boy and scholar had great affection for the 
humble people, for the Indians invaded in their culture, by the blacks who suffered 
under the whips.

The king's friendship, Philip IV, facilitated the realization of Miramez's ancient desire: to know the lands of the New World. The king knew the principles of integrity and the high morale of Ferdinand. However, He thought he had some shortcomings to correct: he was averse to wars, repudiated violence and defended the rights of peoples and, especially, individuals.

Appointed by the king to carry out an ambitious mission of land ownership and to contain Portuguese might, Miramez realizes the opportunity to know and live in the Land of Santa Cruz, and participate in his preparation as the Homeland of the Gospel.

## The language of the heart 
In 1649, Miramez landed as a tourist in Maranhão. In Brazilian lands, he transmits only the events that could be beneficial to Brazil to the sovereign of Spain, omitting the news that could harm the peoples who already lived on earth.

Fernando's detachment was so great that, at first, even without knowing the language, he understood new friends by gestures and intuition. The natives, in turn, saw in him a friend who would provide relief to the sufferings and persecutions they went through.

> " Go, sell all your goods and follow me "

The Indians and slaves were already their family and the return to Spain was not his wish. 
Meditating on his return to his home country, he feels a soft voice, within his 
conscience, which says, "go, sell all your goods, distribute them among the poor 
and you will have a treasure in heaven; then come and follow me!" 
It was the speech of Jesus quoted in the parable of the rich mancebo, present in the Gospel. 
( Matthew, XIX, 16-24, Luke, XVII, 18-25 and mark, X, 17-25).

Surprised, I felt that voice was known to you, but where? And his voice, internally, continued: "Fernando, you can sell all your possessions in Spain and distribute the money among the needy of your homeland! Those here, in need of going through the renewing processes, need your mental wealth more, the result of your working hands, the treasure stored in your heart and your comforting presence!

Following his conscience, the Spanish nobleman sends power of attorney to trusted friends in Spain, authorizing them to sell their assets and distribute the result among the needy and suffering of the Iberian Peninsula. 

## Indians and blacks called him White Father 
Since then, his life has intertwined even more with that of the Indians and blacks of the Land of Santa Cruz. Everyone had him as the White Father, Son of the Sun, or Man who came from the Light.

Catequizadores discovered that cultured and fascinating man as a shepherd of two flocks: working hard for the rapprochement between Indians and blacks and succeeding in friendship between the two races. Thus, Miramez began to frequent the group of catequizadores, because he perceived there field conducive to the practice of his ideals. He succeeded, with his work and joint effort, the promulgation of the Indian protection law in 1680.

Spirit of immense love, Fernando Miramez de Olivídeo resigned to higher levels of light to which he is entitled, for deserving, and remains connected to the beloved Earth, guiding the Spiritist Center Maria Nunes and other works for the progress of humanity.

His death occurred in a picture of high softness. The blacks and the catequized Indians formed extensive lines to kiss their hands, which helped them so much to live. While lucid, Miramez blessed them one by one. In the final moments, Fernando Miramez de Olivídeo realized the presence of the extreme mother, as well as a sublimated entity that he prefers not to identify, because he deems not deserve such honor.

With tears in his eyes, Miramez detached himself from the physical vessel and, outside him, wept with happiness and thanks, for entering Brazil through the doors of love and charity, which were opened to him by Jesus.

As he detached himself from the physical vessel, and already outside it, Miramez cried with happiness and thanks for entering Brazil through the gates of love and charity!
