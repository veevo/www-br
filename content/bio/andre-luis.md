André Luiz was a physician and researcher who lived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil at the beginning of the XX century. After his discarnation, he spent over eight years in the lower zones, being finally rescued by Clarêncio, an assistant from "Nosso Lar", one of the spiritual colonies neighboring Earth. After a period of learning and intense work at Nosso Lar, André Luiz gradually overcame pride and selfishness, and eventually acquired citinzenship at Nosso Lar.

His solid scientific knowledge and great powers of observation have allowed him to recount his experiences as a discarnate being, first in the lower zones and subsequently at Nosso Lar. His experiences and struggles to better himself come down to us through the psychography of Francisco Xavier and are beautifully narrated in the books that comprise the André Luiz Collection or "Life in the Spiritual World."

Faithful to the solid foundation of the codification by Allan Kardec, his novels are an amazing non-fictional, first-hand account of the author’s educational and transforming experiences in the spiritual realm. They all bring to life the teachings of the Spiritist philosophy, the revealing observations of Spiritist science, and the unequivocal operation and justice of the natural laws.

Whether spiritist or not, we should all strive to learn from the pages of his life so we may be better prepared to face our own.
