Camilo Castelo Branco,1st Viscount of Correia Botelho, was a prolific Portuguese
writer of the 19th century, having produced over 260 books. His writing is
considered original in that it combines the dramatic and sentimental spirit of
Romanticism with a highly personal combination of sarcasm, bitterness and dark
humour. He is also celebrated for his peculiar wit and anecdotal character, as
well as for his turbulent life.

Camilo is also know by [spiritists](/about/spiritis) for books
[psicographed](/about/psychography) by [Yvonne Pereira do
Amaral](/bio/yvonne-pereira) including the outstanding [Memoirs of a
suicide](/books/memoirs-of-a-suicide) where he narrates his life
