The reflexive nature of [Spiritism](/spiritism) suggests that people develop
good character traits, such as [kindness](kindness) and
[generosity](generosity). These character traits will, in turn, allow a person
to make the correct decisions later on in life. However, it's not only important
to study virtues but also learn how to break bad habits of character, like
[greed](/studies/vices/greed) or [anger](/studies/vices/anger).

The oldest known type of ethical theory in western philosophy was discussed by
[Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato) who four discussed four key
virtues: [wisdom](wisdom), [courage](courage), [temperance](temperance) and
[justice](justice). [Spiritism](/spiritism) however believe that there are way
more virtues that human beings should develop. For that reason, we prepared this
special section where we list studies on the **Essential Virtues** the human
being should develop.

Virtue-based ethical theories focus on helping people develop good character
traits, such as [kindness](kindness) and [generosity](generosity). These
character traits will, in turn, allow a person to make the correct decisions
later on in life. Virtue theorists also emphasize the need for people to learn
how to break bad habits of character, like [greed](greed) or [anger](anger)

Dates back to the ancient Greek thinkers and is thus the oldest type of ethical
theory in Western philosophy. **Plato discussed four key virtues**:
[wisdom](wisdom), [courage](courage), [temperance](temperance) and
[justice](justice).

[Spiritism](/spiritism) teaches that a major part of a persons spiritual
evolution comes about by changes in conduct. Virtues like [empathy](empathy),
[charity](charity), [indulgence](indulgence) , [humility](humility), and
[love](love) are vital to achieving a higher level of existence. Without these
virtues (along with intellectual progress) a person can never achieve their true
potential. 

## Supreme example of virtues
Jesus was the most evolved Spirit who has ever embodied on this planet; the largest
example of virtues, of the ability to love. And He left us the formula for
"Loving God about all things and others as one
even."
