## Introduction

Virtue-based ethical theories focus on helping people develop good character
traits, such as [kindness](kindness) and [generosity](generosity). These
character traits will, in turn, allow a person to make the correct decisions
later on in life. Virtue theorists also emphasize the need for people to learn
how to break bad habits of character, like [greed](greed) or [anger](anger)

Dates back to the ancient Greek thinkers and is thus the oldest type of ethical
theory in Western philosophy. **Plato discussed four key virtues**:
[wisdom](wisdom), [courage](courage), [temperance](temperance) and
[justice](justice).

[Spiritism](/spiritism) teaches that a major part of a persons spiritual
evolution comes about by changes in conduct. Virtues like [empathy](empathy),
[charity](charity), [indulgence](indulgence) , [humility](humility), and
[love](love) are vital to achieving a higher level of existence. Without these
virtues (along with intellectual progress) a person can never achieve their true
potential.
