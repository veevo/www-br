## What is Humility
The spirits teach us that pride is the most influential moral imperfection and continuously warn their students of its signs and consequences. In avoiding the downfalls caused by pride, the good medium remembers that he is only a simple instrument of others employed under God's will, and, therefore, does not assume any merit for the communications that he receives, or for the healing energies that he helps bring to another.

One also recognizes that he is not infallible, and when duped by deceitful spirits, he understand that this happened as a result of a fault in his character and/or his conduct.  The humble medium is willing to regularly practice self-criticism in order to recognize his own mistakes and avoid becoming unbalanced − through excessive enthusiasm, apathy toward results, or being at mercy of unenlightened spirits who may plan for his failure. In addition to practicing self-criticism, the good medium is also open to constructive criticism from trust-worthy friends and mentors, and even seeks out such advice and mentoring.
