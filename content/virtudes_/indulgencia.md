	- "I'll bet most of you reading this can relate to the struggle back and forth: indulgence vs. virtue, comfort food vs. fitness fuel."

	- "The practice of granting indulgences - remission of punishment for sins through the intercession of the Church - already had a long history."

An extension of the time in which a bill or debt has to be paid.
