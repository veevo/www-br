The question “Is there life after death?” has been the subject of profound discuission and controversey in both the religious and secular world for as long as recorded history. It’s a question that leads us to consider another just as intretsing question. “Why is it so important for us to need to know? Yes, a basic fear of death, the seperation from loved ones, a deeper reason for existing, are all parts of it, but the answer is much more basic, it is all about identity.

## Defining Identity

Identity is defined as: The collective aspect of the set of characteristics by which a thing is definitively recognizable or known. We define ourselves and our resons for being as certain characterstics which are our identity. Charcateristics such as gender, which is our sexual identity within a society. Race identity, the general group from which we are descended, share a common heredity. National identity, how we relate to our country of origin, or of the one we call home. Religious identity, our beliefs about the supernatural, the devine, and the dogmas that accompany those beliefs. Intellectual identity, the role reasoning, learning, questioning and the seeking of knowledge play in our daily lives, the way we or our society sees our intellectual capacity. . Psychological identity that relates to self-image, self-esteem and individualisation. There is also the role identity which is our profession, obligations and our family relationships such as parenthood.

Collectively these factors of identification and all the memories and events which influenced these individuial factors are what we would define as our identity on this Earthly plane. And this collective identity is what we are desperatly hoping will transend death, when we ask that question “Is there life after death?”.

At first glance, in Spiritisim, identity would seems a simple enough topic. Yes, you go on forever because your actually an imortal spirit. The truth is actually not that simple.

Yes, we are all imortal Spirits, but neither “you” nor “I” will go on forever. Why not? Because of identity. The person who we are right now, the personality, habits, abilities, traits, quircks, virtues ,faults and even the gender that make up our identities, are in fact only a tiny fragment of who we actually are. Our true identities are that of our Spirit outside a matterial body. For the spirit, an existance in a matterial body is just a short temporary altered state of being.

The person you are right now, is only a tiny part of your spirit’s identity. Think about this in terms of the events in a matterial life time. Is the person you were in 5th grade , the person you are now? No, why not? Because that was only a small part of your life, countless identity altering experiences have occured since then. Does that mean that the person we were then is completely foreign from who we are now? No, those events are still a small part of who you are, but definately not the total of what you call your identity today. This is the perplexing revelation Spiritism shares with us. Lets try to get a clearer picture of what this all means.

## How our identity is formed

How is identity formed? It is formed through events and experiences, how they affect us and how we react to them. This is both true for our Spirit self, and for us here on earth. Since a large part of a spirits primary state of evolution occures though a long series of rencarenations, it is the product of those reincarnations which form the identity of the Spirit. So lets clarrify some important points about the how science here on Earth has learned about identity, then go on from there.

## Nature vs Nurture

For science this has been the great debate over the factors that influence identty. On one side there is ‘nurture’ the idea that enviormental factors like family, uppbrining, economics, amoung others are the most critical in making us who we are. The other side of the argument is ‘nature’, the belief that it is our dna , our genetic makeup, that defines and determins our identity.

The scientific discoveries that have most influenced the nature vs nurture argument are the identification of the genes that make up our dna (the human genome projerct) and new studies of the diffrences in twins who have been raised in seperate enviorments. As with most science the more that is discovered the more questions appear that need answering. The newest discovery to influence the debate, are ‘epigenetic markers’ which control the intensity of certain genes in our dna, and the fact that these markers are influenced by our enviorment. After so many years of study, for scientists the overall conclusion remains the same, both enviorment and genetics factors define our idetities.

## The Spiritism’s lesson on the Nature Vs Nurture

Spiritism’s lesson on the Nature Vs Nurture debate is that while both are important factors, the main factors are the particular trials and experioences a Spirit has choosen to endure in a particular life time. A spirit chooses the location of its rencarnation, with knowledge of the enviormental factors found there. Chooses the parents to which they will be born, knowing the level of evolution, intensions and limitations these parents posses, and how that will effect how they grow up. The Spirit also balances genetic predispositions as important factors in choosing their parents.

## Making Choices

As discussed in other sections of this Spiritism Guide, when a Spirit disencarnates it relives the major events of that past life both from its own perspective, and from the perspective of everyone he/she has effected with the choices made in that life time. In most cases, this results in a Spirit’s desier to make up for these mistakes and the harm the mistakes caused to others. To achieve this goal, the Spirit wants to put themselves in a possition where they are forced to change their ethical shortcomings. These are the considerations a Spirit has when it is considering the details of its next rencarnation.

When the time comes for a reincarnation, a Spirits’ more evolved guides (with help from even more evolved Spirit Teachers) provied all the information the spirit needs to know in order to make these choices. This includes a list of potential parents that best fit the reincarnating Spirit’s needs. The possible parents come to an agreement with the Spirit who wants to be born as their offspring. This process occures before the parents themselves are rencarnated on Earth. The agrement with these possible parents is that if they are choosen, they will allow the Spirit to be ‘born’, and they will raise this newely reborn Spirit the best of their abilities. When the moment comes the Spirit makes its choices and the long process of reincarnation begins.

## Parents and identity

Other than providing an enviorment and genetic matterial for the rencarnated Spirit, parents in fact have an immencely important role in the identity of a Spirit. As science tells us, childhood for all renmcarnated spirits is a critical time for learning. Not just are the pathways of the brain forming, growing, but the child is litteraly a sponge limited in its capacity for learning, only by the willingess and resources that parents can provide. Parents also have a role in terms of ethics, childhood is a critical time for ethical growth. The bond being formed between parents and offspring are not just physical but also on a spiritual level, it is a trust so great that a Spirit during childhood is very suceptable to a parents influences on their ethical code. To learn about the Ethical Code read the topic ‘Spiritism and Ethics on th Special Topic ssection of this Spiritism guide.

So if parents are willing, viggilant and wise enough, they can profoundly influence a major factor in their childs identity, their code of conduct. Changes the will have lasting effects in every aspect of that childs development, and of the identity that will form throught the child’s lifetime and beyond.

## Inherited Traits

A Spirit chooses its parents partially because of their genetic predispositions. For the Spirit it is important that this new matterial body include certain traits, both positive and negative ones in order to best pay the past debts and achieve the lessons needed from that existance. Traits like predispositions to diseases, artistic pursuits, a higher IQ, athletic ability, and even mediumship can all be factors in a rencarnated Spirit’s development throught a matterial lifetime.

The suffering that comes from disease is a common path for paying past debts, and for learning the critical lessons of empathy, humility and patients. While a high IQ is usually a trait in those who wish to use an existance to contribute medical, technological or other knowledge to mankind. At the same time a high intellect is a powerful temptation that helps such spirits overcome the follies of greed, pride, arropgance and abuses of power. Athletic or artistic abilities too can result in great contributions to humanity, while also provideing the much needed lessons that come from the temptations of substance abuse, selfishness, and abuses in power. Mediumship is an immencely powerful tool for paying past debts and for profound contributuions to humanity, while at the same time providing the powerul temptation to abuse and exploit this ability. Each of thsse experiences and temptations will further alter identity. While overcoming these trials and temptations are critical steps in the overall path of the Spirit’s evolution.

## Remembering Past Lives

Every time a Spirit rencarnates it begins with a clean slate, with the exception of its Ethical Code, having no memory of the countless past lives that have come before. Would it not be easier to learn if a rencarnated Spirit recalled its past mistakes and understood why it was facing the trials and temptation in this life? No, first recalling past lives would neturalize the power parents have for poositive change, such memories would weigh a person down with feelings of guilt, fear and aprehention predisposing them to failure. Second, in order for a person to truly change they must act not out of fear or with forwarning , but out of a deep seeded need for change that comes from enduring the trails and temptations with only their ingrained ethical code to guide them..

There are rare exceptions, people who recall aspects of, or entire past lives. For these individuals recalling these past life events are part of the learning experiences in their present lives. With knowledge of past life events, these individuals are many times compelled to confirm the validity of these memories, and in that way become living testement to the imortality of the Spirit. For others these memories serve as comfort when facing their mortality, while for others they are a powefull eye opener to those who had a closed mind to the idea of the afterlife, God, and the Spirit.

## Conclusion

Spiritisim clarrifications of identity, and of our ‘true’ Spirit self are at the same time consoling, perplexing, and more evidence of a Perfect Creator. Consoling, in our knowledge that death is not the end, all we are is not lost. Perplexing, as it explains the complex and ever evolving identity of the individual. As evidence of a Perfect Creator, because only a Divine Primary Cause of the universe would be wise enough to allow each of us to be the artists of our oun identity and a Divine cause all powerful enough to create a system where, inspite of our vast, ever changeing diffrenes, we remain equal in both natural law and in our evolutionary path toward perfection.

Of all the many lessons this revelation teaches us, the most important lesson about identity that we should carry with us daily is: That as much as our identity may change, we loose nothing, gain unimaginable wisdom, and continue to love those we once loved on Earth.
