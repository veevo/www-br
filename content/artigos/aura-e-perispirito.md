Regarding this point, Barbosa, in the book, "Basic Spiritism" references a passage from the spirit, Andre Luiz, found in "Evolution in Two Worlds". Barbosa writes, "Andre Luiz teaches that all living beings are surrounded by an energetic halo that corresponds to their nature, and that, in human beings, this projection is modified and enriched by the factors of continuous thought, thereby constituting the human aura, the vital body, the ethereal double. Through [this projection], we exteriorize a reflection of ourselves, in accordance with what we think and do."

Barbosa explains that "they are not the same thing, nor do they fulfill the same functions; the former disappears with the death of the physical body, while the second survives the disintegration of the matter and accompanies the spirit to the invisible world. The human aura would be the [outward] radiation of the perispiritual body, and its colors vary in intensity and shade, according to the state of health and the greater or lesser spiritualization of men." (Barbosa, "Basic Spiritism")

Even while undergoing an incarnation or material existence, the spirit, including its perispirit, can momentarily leave the material body while the latter is asleep or in a trance state, though the spirit still remains tied to the body through a fluidic chord.  In this case, the form represented is an exact copy of the material body, and can, if conditions permit, be seen by a medium, or even materialize.
