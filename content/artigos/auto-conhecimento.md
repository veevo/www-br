Just like all animals have an instinctual code of conduct that comes from natural evolution, the spirits within human animals too have an ingrained code of conduct. A code that comes from the conclusions made based on the experiences in present and in past existences. This set of criteria is what we use to make all the decisions of our lives and is called our Ethical Code

Our point of view on every aspect of our life, the way we treat others, treat ourselves, our prejudices, addictions, obsessions, passions, and how we act within society, every choice is based on a corresponding past conclusions found in our ethical code of conduct. Since this ethical code exists in our subconscious mind, ingrained like instinct, even when we seem to act without thought, our impulsive reactions still reflect this criteria.

Unlike the ideal ethical code suggested by the Spirit teachers, our own personal ethical code is far from perfect. Instead it reflects both our best and worst qualities, and everything in between. We (everyone of Earth) are reincarnated Spirits in a lower state of evolution, with many many imperfections. As the word “ignorance” implies, we are very imperfect because there is so much we do not yet know. And so our code reflects what little we have learned and the many lessons we have yet to understand. This is why an ethical code is a reflection of a spirit’s state of evolution.

Unlike character and physical traits which change with every reincarnation, our ethical code is carried intact from reincarnation to reincarnation, always assessable in our subconscious. And unlike our physical bodies which change based on naturally predetermined stations of deterioration, our ethical code is constantly and sporadically changing, based on the choices and the consequences of these choices we make daily. A subsequent reaction to an event either reinforces an already ingrained set of criteria or becomes part of a set of experiences that are influencing changes in that particular criteria.

Because change is an extreamly slow process, a change in our ethics can take countless experiences, through many reincarnations, to have the desired effect. This is why many people seem to remain trapped in the same behavior over and over and over again during a life time, while others seem to make drastic changes in conduct that seem overnight.

## Changing our Ethical Code
Universal Law provides us with two ways to improve our ethical code, one for the short period of time we call the physical life time and the other for the long term series of reincarnations required for Spirit evolution. .

### First Method Of Change
The first method of change is the ideal code of conduct mentioned earlier. Striving daily to live by this code of conduct is the ‘active’ or rational way in which we can bring about these changes in our behavior. It does not matter if we fail every day to apply these changes. Change is a slow process, one that requires constant effort, and countless failures before seeing the desired effect. 

### SELF KNOWLEDGE
A very simple guide to know ourselves exists on the Spirits Book, Book THREE - Chapter 12 on questions 365 and 366: 

> 365. What is the most efficacious method of ensuring one’s own ethical improvement in the present life, and resisting the attraction of evil? “One of the sages of antiquity has told you: ‘Know thyself”.’ 

Then on Q366, Kardec insisted: 

> Do what I myself used to do during my life upon the earth. At the close of each day I examined my conscience, reviewed all that I had done, and asked myself whether I had not failed in some duty, whether some one might not have reason to complain of me. It was in this way that I succeeded in obtaining a know-ledge of myself, and in ascertaining what there was in me that needed reforming. He who, every evening, should thus recall all the actions of the day, asking himself whether he has done ill or well, and praying God and his guardian angel to en-lighten him would acquire great strength for self-improvement, for, believe me, God would assist him. Ask yourself these questions; inquire of yourself what you have done, and what was your aim in such and such a manner; whether you have done anything that you would blame in another; whether you have done anything that you would be ashamed to avow. Ask yourself also this question -‘If it pleased God to call me back, at this moment, into the other life, should I, on returning into the world of spirits, in which nothing is hidden, have to dread the sight of any one? Examine what you may have done, first, against God; next, against your neighbor; and lastly, against yourself. The answers to these questions will either give repose to your conscience, or show you some moral malady of which you will have to cure yourself.

> “Self-knowledge is, therefore, the key to individual improvement; but, you will ask, ‘How is one to judge one’s self? Is not each man subject to the illusions of self-love, which diminish his faults in his own eyes and find excuses for them? …This is true, but you have a means of ascertainment that cannot deceive you. When you are in doubt as to the quality of any one of your actions, ask yourself what would be your judgement in regard to it if it were done by another? If you would blame it in another, it cannot be less blameable when done by you, for God’s justice has neither two weights nor two measures. Endeavour also to learn what is thought of it by others; and do not overlook the opinion of your enemies, for they have no interest in disguising the truth, and God often places them beside you as a mirror, to warn you more frankly than would be done by a friend. Let him, then, who is firmly resolved on self-improvement examine his conscience in order to root out his evil tendencies, as he roots out the weeds from his garden; let him every night. cast up his moral accounts for the day, as the tradesman counts tip his profit and loss; he may be sure that the former will be a more profitable operation than the latter. He who, after this footing tip of his day’s doings, can say that the balance of the account; is in his favour, may sleep in peace, and fearlessly await the moment of his awaking in the other life.

## Conclusion

Spiritisim provides us, not just with an understanding of ethics, but of how we apply ethics in our individual lives, and how our ignorance is reflected in the limitations of our ethical code. It explains the natural laws that govern the Spirit world (universal laws) and how they influence our reincarnations here on earth. It clarifies how we choose trials to force ourselves to modify our conduct. And why applying the ethical lessons found in the teachings of Socrates and Plato, ,the example of Jesus of Nazareth, amoung many others and the suggestions of the Spirit teachers are a way to evolve faster and avoid many painful trials.
