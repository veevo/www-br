Just like all animals have an instinctual code of conduct that comes from natural evolution, the spirits within human animals too have an ingrained code of conduct. A code that comes from the conclusions made based on the experiences in present and in past existences. This set of criteria is what we use to make all the decisions of our lives and is called our Ethical Code

Our point of view on every aspect of our life, the way we treat others, treat ourselves, our prejudices, addictions, obsessions, passions, and how we act within society, every choice is based on a corresponding past conclusions found in our ethical code of conduct. Since this ethical code exists in our subconscious mind, ingrained like instinct, even when we seem to act without thought, our impulsive reactions still reflect this criteria.

Unlike the ideal ethical code suggested by the Spirit teachers, our own personal ethical code is far from perfect. Instead it reflects both our best and worst qualities, and everything in between. We (everyone of Earth) are reincarnated Spirits in a lower state of evolution, with many many imperfections. As the word “ignorance” implies, we are very imperfect because there is so much we do not yet know. And so our code reflects what little we have learned and the many lessons we have yet to understand. This is why an ethical code is a reflection of a spirit’s state of evolution.

Unlike character and physical traits which change with every reincarnation, our ethical code is carried intact from reincarnation to reincarnation, always assessable in our subconscious. And unlike our physical bodies which change based on naturally predetermined stations of deterioration, our ethical code is constantly and sporadically changing, based on the choices and the consequences of these choices we make daily. A subsequent reaction to an event either reinforces an already ingrained set of criteria or becomes part of a set of experiences that are influencing changes in that particular criteria.

Because change is an extreamly slow process, a change in our ethics can take countless experiences, through many reincarnations, to have the desired effect. This is why many people seem to remain trapped in the same behavior over and over and over again during a life time, while others seem to make drastic changes in conduct that seem overnight.

## Changing our Ethical Code
Universal Law provides us with two ways to improve our ethical code, one for the short period of time we call the physical life time and the other for the long term series of reincarnations required for Spirit evolution.

The first method of change was described by [Saint Augustine](/about/st-augustine) on [The Spirits Book](/books/kardec/spirits-book/) and the guide, known as **Self Knowledge**, can be found [here](/articles/self-knowledge).

Striving daily to live by this code of conduct is the ‘active’ or rational way in which we can bring about these changes in our behavior. It does not matter if we fail every day to apply these changes. Change is a slow process, one that requires constant effort, and countless failures before seeing the desired effect.

### A Second method of Change
However, a **second method of change exists**. It happens during our long series of [reincarnations](/about/incarnation), is that of our choice of trials in these life times. After disincarnation we are shown the main experiences of that life time just passed. We are shown these images, and relive the experiences on a deep emotional level, not just from our own POV, but from the pov of those in our lives we have effected. We relive the choices we have made, in a way that feels totally real and also relive these choices.

For most Spirits this results in deep seeded impulses for change. A realization that only by making up for these past mistakes, and by pressuring themselves to change their way of reacting to certain situations, can they come to peace with themselves, and continue the process of Spiritual evolution. The disincarnated Spirit then instigates these changes by choosing the type and intensity of trails for their upcoming life times. 

## What says The Spirits Book
As always, let's check what the Spirits have to say about it. On the **The Spirits Book 2 Chapter 6 - Choice of Trials** we have:


>**258.** In the state of erraticity, and before taking on a new corporeal existence, does a spirit foresee the things which will happen to him in that new existence?  
>“He chooses for himself the kind of trials which he will undergo, and it is in this freedom of choice that his freewill consists.”   

>– It is not God, then, who imposes upon him the tribulations of life as a chastisement?  
>“Nothing comes to pass without the permission of God, for it is He who has established all the laws that rule the universe. You would have to inquire why He has made such and such a law, instead of taking some other way. In giving to a spirit the liberty of choice, He leaves to him the entire responsibility of his acts and of their consequences. There is nothing to bar his future; the right road is open to him as freely as the wrong road. But if he succumbs, there still remains to him the consoling fact that all is not over with him, and that God in His goodness allows him to recommence the task which he has done badly. You must, moreover, always distinguish between what is the work of God’s will and what is the work of man’s will. If a danger threatens you, it is not you who have created this danger, but God; but you have voluntarily elected to expose yourself to this danger, because you have seen in so doing a means of advancement, and God has permitted you to do so.”  
>**259.** If the spirit has the choice of the kind of trials which he will undergo, does it follow that all the tribulations we experience in the earthly life have been foreseen and chosen by us?
> “It would not be correct to say that such has been the case with all of them; for you cannot be said to have chosen and foreseen all the things which happen to you in this life, and all their details. You have chosen the kind of trial to which you are subjected; the details of this trial are a consequence of the general situation which you have chosen, and are often the result of your own actions.
>**260.** How can a spirit choose to be born among those who are leading a bad life?
>“It is necessary for him to be sent into the conditions which will furnish the elements of the trial he has demanded. To this end, there must be a correspondence between the imperfection of which he desires to free himself, and the social surroundings into which he is born. For example, if he have to struggle against the instinct of brigandage, it is necessary for him to be thrown among brigands.”

> **262.** As a spirit, at its origin, is simple, ignorant, and without experience, how can he make an intelligent choice of an existence, and how can he be responsible for such a choice?

> “God supplies what is lacking through his inexperience, by tracing out for him the road which he has to follow, as you do for the infant in its cradle; but he allows him, little by little, to become the master of his choice, in proportion as his free-will becomes developed; and it is then that he often loses his way and takes the wrong road, if he do not listen to the advice of the good spirits, who endeavor to instruct him; it is this which may be called the fall of man.”

> – When a spirit is in possession of his free-will, does the choice of his corporeal existence always depend solely on his own volition, or is this existence sometimes imposed on him by God as an expiation?

> “God can afford to wait; He never hurries the work of expiation. Nevertheless, God does sometimes impose an existence upon a spirit, when the latter, through his ignorance or his obstinacy, is incapable of perceiving what would be to his advantage, and when He sees that this existence may subserve his purification and advancement, while furnishing him also with the conditions of expiation.”

> **264.** What is it that decides a spirit’s choice of the trials which he determines to undergo?  
> “It is necessary for him to be sent into the conditions which will furnish the elements of the trial he has demanded. To this end, there must be a correspondence between the imperfection of which he desires to free himself, and the social surroundings into which he is born. For example, if he have to struggle against the instinct of brigandage, it is necessary for him to be thrown among brigands.”

> **262.** As a spirit, at its origin, is simple, ignorant, and without experience, how can he make an intelligent choice of an existence, and how can he be responsible for such a choice?  
> “God supplies what is lacking through his inexperience, by tracing out for him the road which he has to follow, as you do for the infant in its cradle; but he allows him, little by little, to become the master of his choice, in proportion as his free-will becomes developed; and it is then that he often loses his way and takes the wrong road, if he do not listen to the advice of the good spirits, who endeavor to instruct him; it is this which may be called the fall of man.”

> **264. What is it that decides a spirit’s choice of the trials which he determines to undergo?**  
> “He chooses those which may serve to expiate faults, and at the same time help him to advance more quickly. In view of these ends, some may impose upon themselves a life of poverty privations, in order to exercise themselves in bearing them with courage; others may wish to test their powers of resistance by the temptations of fortune and of power, much more dangerous, because of the bad use that may be made of them, and the evil passions that may be developed by them; others, again, may desire to strengthen their good resolutions by having to struggle against the influence of vicious surroundings.”

266. Does it not seem natural to make choice of such trials as are least painful?

“From your point of view, it would seem to be so, but not from that of the spirit; when he is freed from materiality, his illusions cease, and he thinks differently”.

A spirit may therefore, make choice of the hardest trial, and consequently of the most painful existence, in the hope of thereby attaining more rapidly to a happier state, just as a sick man often chooses the most unpalatable medicine in the hope of obtaining a more rapid cure. … They perceive the ends which these trials are intended to work out-ends far more important for them than the fugitive enjoyments of earth. After each existence, they see the steps they have already accomplished and comprehend what they still lack for the attainment of the purity which alone enable them to reach the goal and they willingly submit to the vicissitudes of corporeal life. Demanding of their own accord to be allowed to undergo those which will aid them to advance most rapidly.

267. Can a spirit make his choice while in the corporeal state?

“His desire may exercise a certain amount of influence, according to the quality of his intention; but, when he returns to spirit-life, he often judges things very differently. It is only as a spirit that he makes his choice; but he may, nevertheless, make it during the material life, for a spirit, even while incarnated, has occasional moments in which he is independent of the matter he inhabits.”

268. Until a spirit has reached the state of perfect purity, has he constantly to undergo trials?

“Yes; but not such as you understand by that term. By the term trials, you understand only material tribulations. But when a spirit has reached a certain degree of purification, although he is not yet perfect, he has no more tribulations of that kind to undergo. He has, nevertheless, to perform creating duties which advance his own improvement, but there is nothing painful in these, as, for example, the duty of aiding others to work out their own improvement.”


## What it all means
In this second form of changing an ethical code, the individual initially takes a more ‘passive’ or reactionary role in the change. A Spirit reincarnates in a new body, bringing with them only their ethical code. Having no conscious memory of their past lives in order to avoid the burden of anger, guilt, depression or confusion that would come about if they recalled those past mistakes. The reincarnated spirit then is confronted with the many difficult trials it had chosen before birth. Trials in which they have to endure the very same mistakes in ethical judgment they acted upon others, except this time they are on the receiving end and not the giving end of the unethical behavior. With only their ethical code to guide them, they react based on the new experiences they are learning from.

At this point the Spirit has one of two choices: One is to search for ‘justice’, meaning they realize that they have been wronged, and learn through the experience why what was done to them was wrong and want to never let that happen to anyone else. So in this situation what was once a spirit’s ethical shortcoming is being modified by a tough lesson in injustice.

The second possible reaction is to seek ‘revenge’, the Spirit was wronged and this becomes justification to wrong others in the same way or even worse. So instead of a mistake in judgment being changed (a new lesson being learned) the mistake is reinforced by a Spirits desire for revenge. In this tragic second scenario the vengeful reincarnated Spirit is choosing to become trapped in a cycle of repeated violence, which we see so commonly in our society. In order for the Spirit to force itself to change its behavior it will choose harsher and harsher trials during its continuing lifetimes until finally the long suffering spirit alters the error in its ethical code of conduct.

## Conclusion
Spiritisim provides us, not just with an understanding of ethics, but of how we apply ethics in our individual lives, and how our ignorance is reflected in the limitations of our ethical code. It explains the natural laws that govern the Spirit world (universal laws) and how they influence our reincarnations here on earth. It clarifies how we choose trials to force ourselves to modify our conduct. And why applying the ethical lessons found in the teachings of Socrates and Plato, ,the example of Jesus of Nazareth, amoung many others and the suggestions of the Spirit teachers are a way to evolve faster and avoid many painful trials.
