A common question, and often declared as [miracle](/about/miracles) is: **Is it possible to cure someone just by using the prayer?**

This topic has been researched by [Allan Kardec](/profiles/allan-kardec) and on the book [Genesis](/books/allan-kardec/genesis), he declares:
> "The ability to heal through fluidic interaction is very common and can be developed through exercise, but the instant cure via imposition of the hands is much more rare and its appearance in the maximum degree should be considered exceptional.  Even so, in diverse periods throughout history, and amidst almost all peoples, there have been individuals who have had the faculty to an outstanding degree."  

So it is indeed scientificly possible (and has happened) including as narrated by [Emmanuel](/profiles/emmanuel) on the beautiful [Paul and Stephen](/books/emmanuel/paul-and-stephen) on at least two occasions: when [Stephen](/profiles/stephen) and [Paul of Tarsus](/profiles/paul-of-tarsus) utilizing their hands cure people from blindness.

[Jesus](/about/jesus) himself in innumerous passages of the Bible has also used the same mechanism to cure those who looked for him.

So as we can see, it is not about a _miracle_ but a very concrete possibility that, one, emmanated by these healing fluids could indeed cure another person.
