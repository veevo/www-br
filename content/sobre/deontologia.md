The correct ethical choices come from an understanding of our ‘moral’ duties and a knowledge of the rules exist to regulate those duties. When we follow our duty, we must be behaving ‘morally’. These duties, rules, and obligations are determined by God. Being ‘moral’ is a matter of obeying God. The consequences of these choices, and/or the personal character of the person are irrelevant. Only the intent of following the moral law and actually obeying these laws without question, is relevant in this school of thought.

Spiritism teaches how vital it is to make personal, informed and reasoned choices in our lives. So the concepts of duty and blind obedience are considered very unwise. A person can only make a truly ethical choice when it is done honestly and with a clear rational understanding of why they are making that choice.

That said, Spiritism does reflect aspects of the Deontological school of thought through a focus on ‘intent’ when making a choice. All of us here on Earth are spirits in a lower level of evolution and as such are extreamly limited both in our ethical and scientific understanding of all aspects of life. Since for us learning is an extremely slow and many times painful process, the majority of the choices we make, will not have the results we expect. We may have the intent and assurance that the choices we are making are correct but in fact many are not. Since our choices can only reflect our level of knowledge at the time we are making them.

Spiritism clarifies that our honest intent when making a choice is given great importance in terms of whether or not our choice is correct or not. Without this aspect of universal justice, all of our actions would be unethical since none of us here on Earth are evolved enough to display true wisdom. A balance between what we have done (the consequences of actions) and what we intended (what we wanted to happen) is also critical in the learning process.

Spiritism also has Deontological implications in its clarifications of universal law (not Biblical old testament laws) and focuses on the importance of our understanding these laws and how they affect our choices and who we are.
