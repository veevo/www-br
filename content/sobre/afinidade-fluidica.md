We are all always equal in the eyes of our creator, God. Every spirit that will ever incarnate and/or reincarnate on earth is governed by the same divine laws and on the same path of evolution as the rest of us. The belief in the superiority of one group over another is a violation of Godâ€™s law. And the negation of the basic truth that we are all brothers and sisters. The reality of reincarnation also completely obliterates the idea of inequality.

As part of our evolution we will be reincarnated countless times and in countless bodies of all races, religions, genders, social statuses and states of health. As for the idea of superiority or inferiority of a person based on the level of evolution of their Spirit, this too is an illusion.

All spirits who incarnate/reincarnate on an earthly world are basically on the same level of evolution. Once that basic level of evolution has been achieved, the spirit no longer needs to reincarnate in a human form. It is also important to realize that those who cling to the idea of superiority and inferiority are not those who are searching for the path to their own ethical and intellectual evolution.
