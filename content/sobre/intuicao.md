## Definição

It is through the kind of exchanges previously mentioned that spirits are able
to suggest ideas to us that we receive in the form of intuitions. Good and
friendly spirits who wish to help us on our road of progress will suggest to us
ideas that can, should we listen to them, help us to make good decisions. This
is often the case when we are pondering over a decision we must make or are
seeking the best way to finish a given task, and, almost as if “out of the
blue”, an idea comes to mind that leads us to the answer we needed. Suggestions
of good advice, however, don’t always “spring” upon us, as they may simply
become interwoven into the orderly thought process through which we arrive at
our decision.
