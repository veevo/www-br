## What is God?

» God is the supreme intelligence and primary cause of all things [1].  
» God is eternal, immutable, unique, omnipotent, supremely just and good.  
» The universe is a creation of God. It encompasses all beings, whether they be rational or irrational, animate or inanimate, material or immaterial.  
» All the laws of nature are [Divine Laws](/divine-laws) because God is their author. They cover both the physics and moral laws.   

## What are the proofs of God’s existence?
» Look for the cause of things which are not the work of human beings, and your reason will provide the answer [2]

> "We constantly see an immensity of effects, whose cause is not in Humanity, since Humanity is incapable of producing them. The cause is above Humanity. It is that cause we call God, Jehovah, Allah, Brahma, Fo-hi, Great Spirit, etc. Such effects are absolutely not produced by chance, by accident, or without order. From the organization of the smallest insect and the most insignificant seed, to the laws that govern the worlds that circulate through Space, everything gives proof of one guiding idea, a scheme, a foresight, a thoroughness in care, all of which surpass any human creations."
