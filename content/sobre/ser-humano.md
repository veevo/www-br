Human Being is a [Spirit](/about/spirits) [incarnated](/about/incarnation) in a
[material body](/about/physical-body). The [perispirit](/about/perispirit) is
the semi-material body that unites the Spirit to the [physical
body](/about/physical-body).

In addition to the [material world](/about/material-world) inhabited by
incarnate Spirits, which are Human Beings, there exists the spiritual world,
inhabited by discarnate Spirits.

Human Beings are given the [free will to act](/divine-laws/free-will), but they
must answer for the consequences of their actions. Within the Universe there are
other inhabited worlds, with beings at different degrees of evolution: some
equal, others more or less evolved than Human Beings.
