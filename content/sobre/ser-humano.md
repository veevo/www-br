## A Human according to Spiritism

Human Being is a [Spirit](/about/spirits) [incarnated](/about/incarnation) in a [material body](/about/physical-body). The [perispirit](/about/perispirit) is the semi-material body that unites the Spirit to the [physical body](/about/physical-body).

In addition to the [material world](/about/material-world) inhabited by incarnate Spirits, which are Human Beings, there exists the spiritual world, inhabited by discarnate Spirits.

Human Beings are given the [free will to act](/divine-laws/free-will), but they must answer for the consequences of their actions. Within the Universe there are other inhabited worlds, with beings at different degrees of evolution: some equal, others more or less evolved than Human Beings.
