Theories focusing on the consequences any action might have. Understanding the results of a choice is vital to identifying if it is the ‘right’ choice. Correct consequences only come from correct choices, incorrect consequences must come from incorrect choices.

Consequentialism is considered controversial by critics because it neglects to analyze the nature (cause) of the consequences that are being labeled ‘good’ or ‘bad’. In this school of thought any pleasurable act such self indulgence and even masochism can be labeled as having good consequences, therefore coming from good choices.

Spiritisim teaches us about the importance of action and consequence as well, though focusing on a non-materialistic pov.. Universal Law assures that actions and choices have corresponding consequences that reflect the ethical or unethical nature of the action. It is as important to explore the results of your actions as it is to identify the cause.
