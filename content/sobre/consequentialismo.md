## Definição
Theories focusing on the consequences any action might have. Understanding the
results of a choice is vital to identifying if it is the ‘right’ choice.
Correct consequences only come from correct choices, incorrect consequences
must come from incorrect choices.

Consequentialism is considered controversial by critics because it neglects to
analyze the nature (cause) of the consequences that are being labeled ‘good’ or
‘bad’. In this school of thought any pleasurable act such self indulgence and
even masochism can be labeled as having good consequences, therefore coming
from good choices.

Spiritisim teaches us about the importance of action and consequence as well,
though focusing on a non-materialistic pov.. Universal Law assures that actions
and choices have corresponding consequences that reflect the ethical or
unethical nature of the action. It is as important to explore the results of
your actions as it is to identify the cause.
