## Definição
Espírito [do latim spiritu] - No sentido especial da Doutrina Espírita, os
Espíritos são os seres inteligentes da criação, que povoam o Universo, fora do
mundo material, e constituem o mundo invisível. Não são seres oriundos de uma
criação especial, porém, as almas dos que viveram na Terra, ou nas outras
esferas, e que deixaram o invólucro corporal.

Human Being is a Spirit incarnated in a material body. The perispirit is the
semi-material body that unites the Spirit to the physical body.

In addition to the corporeal world inhabited by incarnate Spirits, which are
Human Beings, there exists the spiritual world, inhabited by discarnate Spirits.

### Creation of Spirits
Spirits are created simple and ignorant.  
The Spirits are the intelligent beings of creation.  
They constitute the world of the Spirits, which pre-exists and outlives everything.  

### Evolution of Spirits
They evolve intellectually and morally, passing from a lower order to a higher one, until they attain perfection, where they will enjoy unalterable bliss.  
Spirits are always progressing. In their multiple physical existences, they may sometimes become stationary but they never regress. The speed of their intellectual and moral progress depends on the efforts they make to attain perfection.  

### Order of Spirits
Spirits belong to different orders according to the degree of perfection they have attained:
* Pure Spirits, who have attained maximum perfection;
* Good Spirits, whose predominant desire is towards goodness; and
* Imperfect Spirits, characterized by their ignorance, their tendency towards evil, and by their lower passions.

### Incarnation
Spirits preserve their individuality before, during, and after each incarnation.  
Spirits reincarnate as many times as is necessary for their spiritual advancement.

### Progression
Spirits are always progressing. In their multiple physical existences, they may sometimes become stationary but they never regress. The speed of their intellectual and moral progress depends on the efforts they make to attain perfection.

### Interaction with Humanity
The Spirits’ relations with Human Beings are constant and have always existed. The Good Spirits attract us towards goodness, sustain us in life’s trials, and help us bear them with courage and resignation. The Imperfect Spirits induce us towards error.
