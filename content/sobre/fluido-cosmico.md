The universal cosmic fluid is, as has already been demonstrated, is the
primitive material element, the modifications and transformations of which
constitute the innumerable variety of the bodies of nature (Chapter X.)  As a
principal element of the universe, it assumes two distinct states: that of
etherealization or imponderability, which can be considered its normal
primitive state, and that of materialization or ponderability, which is, to
some degree, consecutive of the first. The intermediary point between them is
that of the transformation of the ethereal fluid into tangible material.  Even
at that point of transition, however, there is not an abrupt change from one
state to another, whereby we can consider our imponderable fluids as an
intermediary condition between the two states (see Chapter IV, items 10 and
following).

Each one of these two states gives rise, naturally, to special phenomena.
Related to the second state  (materialization) are the phenomena of the visible
world.  Related to the first state (etherealization) are the phenomena of the
invisible world.  Some, the so-called material phenomena, are within reach of
science.  Others, referred to as spiritual or psychic phenomena, because of
their special tie to the existence of spirits, fall within the attribution of
Spiritism.  However, as the spiritual life and the corporeal life are in
constant contact with one another, the phenomena of both categories are often
produced simultaneously.  In the state of incarnation, humans are only able to
perceive the psychic phenomena that are tied to the corporeal life; those of
the spiritual domain escape the material senses and can only be perceived in
the spirit state.

In the state of etherealization, the cosmic fluid is not uniform; while still
of an ethereal nature, it undergoes modifications as varied in their kind and
more numerous than in the state of tangible material.  These modifications form
distinct fluids which, in spite of originating from the same source, are all
endowed with special properties and give rise to the peculiar phenomena of the
invisible world.

Within the relativity of everything, these fluids have for the spirits, who are
also fluidic, an appearance that is as material for them as the tangible,
material objects are for the incarnate, and they are, for the spirits, what the
substances of the material world are for us.  They manipulate and combine them
to produce certain effects, just as humans do with their material objects,
though the processes are not the same.

In the spirit world, however, as it is in this world, only the most
knowledgeable spirits are able to comprehend the role of elements that
constitute the world in which they find themselves.  The ignorant beings of the
invisible world are quite incapable of explaining the phenomena that they
witness and even contribute to, in an automated manner, just as the ignorant
beings of the Earth are unable to explain the phenomena of light or
electricity, to elucidate how they are able to see and hear them.

The fluidic elements of the spiritual world escape the analysis by our
instruments, as well as the perception by our senses  which were designed to
perceive the tangible, but not the ethereal.  There are some spiritual fluids
that pertain to environments so different from our own, that we can only
imagine them through comparisons as imperfect as one that could be made by a
person born blind who tried to imagine colors based only on theory.

There are other such fluids, however, that are so intimately tied with the
corporeal life that, to a certain degree, they pertain to the earthly
environment.  Without direct observation, their effects can be observed, as we
observe the fluids (energies) of a magnet  ̶  fluids that have never been seen,
whereby we can acquire knowledge about the nature of those fluids with some
degree of precision.  Such study is essential, because it holds the key to an
immensity of phenomena that cannot be explained by the material laws alone.

An absolute purity, one that we cannot imagine, is the starting point, or the
original state, of the universal fluid; the opposite point is that in which it
is transformed into tangible material.  Along the spectrum that runs between
those two extremes, there are innumerable degrees of transformation.  The
fluids  that are closest to the point of materialization, the less pure fluids,
consequently, make up what is referred to as the spiritual atmosphere of the
Earth.    It is in that environment, where the degrees of purity are equally
varied, that the incarnate and discarnate beings of the planet Earth find the
materials necessary to meet the needs of their existence.   In spite of being
so subtle and impalpable to us incarnate beings, these fluids are still
considered to be of a dense, impure nature, in comparison to the ethereal
fluids of the superior regions.

The situation is the same in relation to other worlds, only with the
appropriate modifications to meet each world’s inhabitants’ physical needs of
life.  The less material a life is in a given world, the less affinity the
spiritual fluids have with the so-called matter.

The use of the descriptive, spiritual fluids, as such, is not totally correct
since, by definition, these fluids are still matter, more or less
quintessential.  What can be classified as truly spiritual is only the soul, or
the intelligent principle.  The fluids are given that denomination only in
comparison and as a reflection of their affinity with the spirits.  We could
say that they are the matter of the spiritual world, whereby they are called
spiritual fluids.

¹  Editor’s note: Remember that matter, as we know it, is only a transformation
of the cosmic principle (imagine as a condensation or a lower degree of
vibration) to the point that it becomes the tangible matter of the material
world that we know.
