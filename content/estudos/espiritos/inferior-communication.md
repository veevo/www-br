## Characteristics of Inferior spirits and their Communications
Here's a summary of the communication of the Superior Spirits:
* Use low and unsuitable language.
* Evidence a want of kindness or nobility.
* Take scrutiny amiss and try to dissuade us from engaging in it.
* Language always shows some trace of human passions, every expression indicating ignorance, vulgarity, arrogance, boastfulness, or acrimony − characteristic of inferiority and fraud (if using an honored name).
* Meaning of communications is not consistent; statements are illogical, unreasonable, and unwise.
* Talk boldly of everything, regardless of truth.
* Make random predictions of future events with minute assertions in regard to pretended facts of which we know nothing (For example, an announcement of some given event, as being destined to occur at given time, is usually a hoax).
* Often endeavor to disguise their poverty of ideas under a pompous and inflated style, and are often pretentious, ridiculous, or obscure, while trying to appear profound.
* Are imperious; they give orders, try to make us obey them, and persist in staying, even when bidden to go away
* Exclusive and absolute in their opinions; pretend that they alone speak the truth.  They demand a blind credence and never appeal to reason, which would unmask their pretensions.
* Overwhelm us with exaggerated praise; contrive to stimulate pride and vanity, even while ostensibly preaching humility.
* Assume eccentric and ridiculous names, trying to impose on our credulity.  
* Borrow great names, often seeking to flatter a medium's vanity and then lead him on to regrettable absurdities.
* Delight in bringing evil into view; exaggerate, blame, and excite discord by perfidious insinuations.
* Make suggestions opposed to common sense and to the laws of nature.
* Physical indications - action on the medium is sometimes violent, producing in him a feverish or convulsive agitation, or causing him to make abrupt and jerking motions.
* Give perverse counsels
* Excite distrust and animosity against those whom they dislike, and direct their animadversions especially against those who are able to detect their inferiority.
* Seek out the weak in order to lead them astray, employing, by turns, sophistry, sarcasm, abuse, and even physical violence, as proof of their occult power; they do their utmost to turn their prey from the path of truth.
* Those who have busied themselves with one single idea or pursuit during their earthly life often remain, for long periods, under the sway of their terrestrial ideas, and retain many of the prejudices, predilections, and even manias of their earthly life.
* Satire of spirits of a lower degree, who, without being rude, are sometimes fond of bantering, is often sharp and perfectly to the point.
