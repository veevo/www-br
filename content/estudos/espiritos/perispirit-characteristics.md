## Characteristics of the Perispirit

### Formation
The perispirit is formed from the [cosmic fluid](/about/cosmic-fluid), is extracted from current environment (which varies between worlds), evolves along with the spirit and becomes less material as the spirit progresses.

### Purity
The degree of purity of the perispirit depends on the atmospheric fluids and on the spirit's level of moral evolution. As the spirit morally advances, the perispirit becomes less material. This allows the spirit to do certain tasks that less moraly advanced spirits can't.

### Form
The form of the perispirit on the human being, is that of the body. As the spirit is always tied to the perispirit, the latter is in contact with the whole human organism absorbing all physical modifications done to the body (including illnesses and accidents).

On discarnate spirit, the form can vary. For more elevated spirits, it is that they wish to give it (if they know how to). For less advanced spirits, it is usually the same form as the body it took in its last incarnation. See [Kardec's](/profiles/allan-kardec) explanations on [Genesis](/books/allan-kardec/Genesis), [Chapter 14 - Items 9](/books/allan-kardec/Genesis/14-9) and [Chapter 14 - Item 11](/books/allan-kardec/Genesis/11) for more details.

Note that the perispirit can be modelled thus is not limited, however, to the form or outline of the human body. More on that later.
