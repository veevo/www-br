## Tendencies, Vices, and Virtues of Spirits
> "It would be illogical to assume that the spirit of a savage or criminal suddenly becomes wise and virtuous. It would also be illogical to suppose that, contrary to God's justice, they continue perpetually in a state of inferiority."<br><br>Allan Kardec

The study of spirits who reveal themselves¹ to be at a variety of levels, as well as the instruction received from superior spirits, have confirmed that just as there are humans at all levels of knowledge and ignorance, of goodness and badness, the same is true for the discarnate spirits that populate the spirit world.

Therefore, freedom from the physical body does not rid a spirit of its inclinations or tendencies. To the contrary, its elevation as a spirit is proportional to its advancements made over multiple existences.  As said before, spirits are merely the souls of men.  From one incarnation to the next, and also between the incarnations, all spirits maintain their individuality, including the level of moral and intellectual advancement they have achieved at any given time.  Therefore, the spirit world reflects all the vices and virtues of human beings living on Earth.  In fact the scale is even greater in the spirit realm because it includes spirits that come from other worlds, whereby they can be at levels far higher than the most distinguished of men, or far lower than the least advanced person on Earth.

In a most generalized classification, the spirit-instructors describe three principle classes among spirits: the pure spirits, who have attained the highest degree of perfection; the good spirits, characterized by the predominance of of their ethical nature over their material instincts; and the inferior spirits, characterized by the predominance of their material instincts and a possible tendency for harmful acts.
