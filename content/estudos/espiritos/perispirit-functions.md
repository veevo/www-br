## Functions of the Perispirit

### Intermediary Between Spirit and Matter
The semi-material, spiritual body unites the spirit and the material body, making reciprocal influences between the two possible and serving as an instrument for the transmission of sensations between them, thus allowing the spirit to act upon matter.

When the sensations come from the exterior, we can say that the body receives the impression, the perispirit transmits it, and the spirit, the invisible and intelligent being, registers it.

When a directive for actions initiates in the spirit, we can say that the spirit wants, the perispirit vibrates in transmission of the message, and the material body executes.   


### Mold for the Physical Body & Form for the Discarnate Spirit

The "directive idea" for the organization and development of the physical body is held in the vital fluid, which is united with the perispirit upon reincarnation in a physical body.  Gabrielle Dellane writes¹, "The perispirit, through its impregnation or transfusion with this vital fluid, and in becoming intimately tied with it, materializes sufficiently enough to become the director or regulator, the support for the vital energy modified by heredity.  It is thanks to this vital fluid that the type of individual is formed, developed, conserved, and then destroyed…." 

Through this process, the perispirit contains, fluidically, the cells, organs, and instruments that condense on the material body. The human form then becomes a reflection of the perispirit, whereby we say that it is the perispirit that determines its form or outline, size, and other physical aspects, as well as the illnesses to which it is predisposed and other predetermined physical modifications, in accordance with the inheritance that the spirit has accumulated in its various reincarnations².

In this function, the perispirit, again through the action of the vital principle³, also maintains the integrity of the physical body and its cells that undergo a continuous renovation.

With reference to the discarnate spirit, the perispirit continues to give form to the spirit, allowing it to conserve the human appearance with which it identifies.
