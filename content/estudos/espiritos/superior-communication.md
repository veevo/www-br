## Characteristics of Superior spirits and their Communications
Here's a summary of the communication of the Superior Spirits:
* Always couched in simple and dignified language.
* Show kindness and benevolence, not hatred (either for men or other spirits).
* Only desire the good of others.
* Only give utterance to kind  and  noble sentiments.
* Never are offended by examination of their communications; on the contrary, they advise it and have nothing to fear.
* Language is always dignified, noble, elevated, and clear.
* Express themselves with simplicity and modesty, never make a parade of their learning nor boast of their position in the spirit world.
* The meaning of their communications is always the same. Their thoughts are also consistent, independent of time and place of transmissions.  Communications are more or less developed, according to circumstances, needs, and facilities of communication; but they are never contradictory.
* Only state what they know; are silent or confess ignorance with regard to subjects with which they are unacquainted.
* May sometimes give us a hint or presentiment of future events, when some useful end is to be gained by doing so, but never, or rarely, give minute details or fixed dates.
* Express themselves simply and concisely; communications are clear, intelligible, and easily understood.
*  Never command, never assume airs of authority; give only counsel. If we do not listen to them, they retire.
* Never flatter; approve what is right, but always with moderation.
* Are above formalities and trifles.
* Are scrupulous of giving us advice in regard to our action in the affairs of our daily life, and only do so for the attainment of some serious and useful end.  (We must never act upon any spirit advice, unless the advice thus given is entirely approved of by our reason and judgment).
* Are prudent in regard to all that could compromise individuals; to unveil evil is repugnant to them.
* Only prescribe what is good; counsel is always in strict conformity with the purest form of charity as exemplified by the teachings of Jesus in the Gospel.
* Only make statements in perfect accordance with reason and laws of nature.
* Physical indications − calmness and gentleness in treatment of the medium.
* Pleasantry is often subtle and keen, but never undignified.
