## Categories of Spiritis

As each individual on Earth is different and has different levels of virtues, ethical and intellectual progress, the same happens on the [spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world). The dimension and condition in which each Spirit exists directly relates to this level of progress, as so does the Spirit’s characteristics.

A good introduction to the topic can be found on the introduction of  [The Spirits Book's](/books/allan-kardec/spirits-book), Chapter 5: 

> This classification, however, is by no means absolute. It is only in its totality that the character of each category is distinctly marked, for each category merges in the one above it by imperceptible gradations, the peculiarities of the successive categories shading off into one another at their extremities, as is the case in the various reigns of nature, in the colors of the rainbow, in the phases of a human life. Spirits may, therefore, be divided into a number of classes more or less considerable, according to the point of view from which we consider the subject. It is in this matter as in all other systems of scientific classification. The systems adopted may be more or less complete, more or less rational, and more or less convenient for the understanding; but, whatever may be their form, they change nothing in regard to the facts of the science which employs them. <br><br>
> The higher spirits generally admit the existence of three principal categories, or main divisions, among the people of the other world. In the lowest of these, at the bottom of the ladder, are the imperfect spirits who are characterized by the predominance of the instincts of materiality over the moral nature, and by the propensity to evil. Those of the second degree are characterized by the predominance of the moral nature over the material instincts, and by the desire of good. They constitute the category of good spirits. The first or highest category consists of those who have reached the state of pure spirits, and have thus attained to the supreme degree of perfection imaginable by us.

Although as previously said, "this classification is by no means absolute", we can group them in thre main groups: **Imperfect, Good and Pure**. We'll learn about them on the next topics.
