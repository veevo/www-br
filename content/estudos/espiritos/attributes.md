## Attributes of Spirits
The text to follow provides details on some of the most significant attributes of the spirit, necessary to understand the spirits' immaterial nature.

### Immortality
This is a quality attributed to the soul, by which it survives the death of the physical body.

### Individuality
From the moment a spirit is created, it maintains its individuality, i.e., its personal characteristics, tendencies, vices and virtues, moral and intellectual advancements, etc. The eternal spirit retains this individuality at all times, from one incarnation to the next and in between incarnations.  The inferior characteristics of a spirit, however, are never eternal. In obedience to the law of progress, and aided by the infinite, educational resources employed by God, each spirit will evolve at its own rate and one day reach the highest level of purification. 

### Intelligence, thought and reason
Intelligence is an attribute of the spirit, which allows the spirit to generate thought, to reason, and to act with pre-meditation. The source of the spirits' intelligence is the universal intelligence.  However, spirits tell us¹  that while intelligence is an attribute of each being that has it, and it constitutes the individuality of those beings, it would not be an exact comparison to say that each intelligent being draws a portion of intelligence from the universal source and assimilates it, like it does with the vital principle.  We humans have yet to fully understand this concept.  It should be noted that instinct is a form of unreasoning intelligence, through which all beings provide for their needs.  Therefore, it varies according to the species.  In humans, it does not diminish as intelligence grows². There's no distinct line between instinct and intelligence, and they often blend; however, their actions are more distinguishable. While the actions stemming from intelligence come from thought and deliberation, those stemming from instinct are almost always spontaneous. In beings with self-consciousness and perception of outside things, instinct is aligned to intelligence, i.e., to freedom of will and action.

### CONSCIENCE
Reflecting the greatness and sublimity of our creator, conscience is a faculty that allows spirits, both incarnate and discarnate, to pass moral judgment over their own thoughts and actions.  It is in the conscience that the law of God is "written", whereby we have been given the tools to discern good from bad.  Since our creation as spirits, we have forgotten or misunderstood the law, and God has willed it to be recalled to our memories, through revelations, intuitive suggestions from good spirits, and our own experiences over multiple existences.  Therefore, our ability of discernment depends on our level of evolution.  When we incarnate in a physical body, we preserve an intuitive memory of the law, again, the strength of which depends upon our moral and intellectual advancement.  This memory, however, will suffer the influence of our lower instincts, and it is through the process of reincarnation that we gradually work to lift that veil of imperfections "until we reach the plentitude of psychic perfection and an integral knowledge of our own self."¹

### Free will and responsibility
Free will refers to the ability of a spirit to follow the path that it creates for itself, making its own decisions and choosing its own acts. The discarnate spirit enjoys that liberty when it has reached a level of evolution in which it is allowed to chose, whether alone or with guidance of mentors, the trials and expiations of its next incarnation.  The incarnate spirit conserves this freedom of action in order to fight against the struggles of the material life.  These struggles serve as trials that test some knowledge previously gained, or as expiations that that afford ways to make amends for past wrong-doings.  The spirit develops free will as it gains self-awareness throughout the course of its incarnations.

Free will is a right that a spirit holds by nature. The spirits teach us that an alteration of our mental faculties, through a natural or accidental cause, is the only case in which man is deprived of his free will.  However, it must be understood that spirits do not have absolute freedom, that is, a freedom of action with no consequence.  The more enlightened a spirit's conscience is, the greater its free will, and the more accountable it will be for its actions.  This is where responsibility is employed.  The spirits tell us¹ that we do not experience absolute freedom of action because we need one another.  They explain that only a hermit in a desert enjoys such freedom, for as soon as two people find themselves together, they have reciprocal rights and duties to respect, whereby they are no longer absolutely free.  It should also be pointed out that our evolutionary progress depends our abilities to interact appropriately with our fellow human beings, and therefore, the life of a hermit does not allow for such an advancement.

While such an absolute freedom, as mentioned above, does not exist, the spirits tell us² that there is one condition in which we can enjoy absolute liberty, and that is in thought.  They say that "God alone has full awareness of our thoughts and deplores or approves them according to the dictates of Divine justice."

### Relative Power
This attribute refers to a power relative to that of God.  You will often hear or read that spirits are working toward perfection.  However, by perfection, we do not mean an absolute perfection, for that is an attribute that pertains only to God.  We refer, rather, to the plentitude of living and being in the divine perfection and having reached the highest stage of moral and intellectual evolution, the maximum in expansion of the conscience, whereby the spirit identifies itself with the divine conscience. 

### Travel and Penetration of Matter
In a general sense, discarnate spirits are able to travel throughout the universe, and they do so by use of their will, or thought.  Thus they can travel at the speed of thought, or they may choose to do so at a speed in which they are aware of the space they are traversing.  Matter does not obstruct the spirits' movement. They are able to pass through air, earth, water, fire, any man-made material, etc. These abilities in transportation, however, as well as the regions to which they may travel, depend on the degree of the spirits' moral and intellectual evolution and their present state of awareness.

### Perceptions and Sensations
The nature and degree of perceptions and sensations depend on the spirits' degree of evolution. The less evolved spirits still involve themselves with the things that they were engaged in during their Earthly lives. For example, a miser, once disincarnated, will still try to guard and look after his treasure, and suffers for not being able to touch and handle his gold.  Another spirit who, while living on Earth, cultivated resentments toward another individual, will continue to focus its thoughts and energies in the same way after passing on to the spirit realm, and will seek to act upon such sentiments. Even after losing their material bodies, the spirits remain influenced by moral vices and will continue to seek out satisfaction for their cravings; that is, until they make the efforts to change  their ways.  However, spirits of a morally sound nature have occupations of a more intellectual and charitable nature. They engage themselves in study and in work that involves the assistance and guidance of men and inferior spirits, all the while without forgetting those still living on Earth for whom they hold loving affections and who they work to protect and guide as much as they can.
