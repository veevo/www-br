## The Perispirit
As described on [Spirits Book](/books/allan-kardec/spirits-book/), [Question 135](/books/allan-kardec/spirits-book/135), the human being is formed of three essential elements: **the body, the soul and a semi-material form called the persispirit**. 

Here's how [Allan Kardec](/profiles/allan-kardec) describes on [Question 135](/books/allan-kardec/spirits-book/135):
> "The first element is the body, which humans have in common with animals. As such, the body is animated by the same vital principle that exists in animals.  The second element is the soul or incarnate spirit, of which the body is the habitation and through which it acts.  The third element is a semi-material form called the perispirit; it constitutes the spirit's innermost envelope and unites the spirit with the body."

The perispirit is the spiritual body: the spirit's fluidic, vaporous, quintessential, semi-material envelope, having both flexibility and expandability.  

The perispirit accompanies the spirit in all states. It unites the spirit and the body when incarnated and is the _body_ of the spirit while discarnated. It It has many important functions in the spirits' interaction with the spiritual and material worlds, as well as its own evolution.
