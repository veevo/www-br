## Fluidified Water

Lastly, as was mentioned previously, another application of magnetism used by Spiritist centers is the use of magnetized or fluidified water.  The water is used for its strong capabilities of energy capture and transmission. Through the processes of spiritual or semi-spiritual magnetism, water that has been designated for such use is magnetized, whereby it is impregnated with healthy, restorative fluids that benefit those who drink it.  This treatment is normally used in combination with the hand passes.
