## Introduction
Fluidic therapy, employed in Spiritist centers through the application of hand passes and the usage of fluidified (energized) water, is, in its most simple definition, the transmission of vital and spiritual energies for the benefit of others. You may also hear the technique of hand passes referred to, within the Spiritist arena, as spiritual or magnetic healing, or bioenergetic therapy.
