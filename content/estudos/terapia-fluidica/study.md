## Spiritist Study
Though we've presented here only a brief introduction to this topic, Spiritism, today, offers a considerable amount of information regarding the mechanisms at work in the processes of pass-giving and pass-receiving.  And just as with the faculties of intellectual and physical mediumship, it does not stop at explaining how the magnetic forces work and how to apply them; it also teaches us about the serious responsibilities of those who choose to cooperate with the higher spirits and offer themselves as instruments in the physical and spiritual healing of others.  In addition, it educates those who are receiving the benefits of passes on what they must do to facilitate the reception of the donated fluids and the activation of their healing potential.

Hopefully, with time, more of these resources will be translated into English.  However, we recommend a publication entitled "Practical Guide for Magnetic and Spiritual Healing", a compilation of texts from various, reputable Spiritist sources, which have been translated and put together in a comprehensive and  instructive guidebook. In this book, you will find the fundamentals of magnetism and the application of passes, as taught by Spiritism.  Topics include:
- the basic concepts of fluids, spiritual fluids and the vital fluid
- the perispirit and the vital forces or chakras
- the reception and distribution of energies throughout the spiritual and physical body
- who is involved in the work: the pass-giver, the patient, and spiritual benefactors
- the appropriate time, places, and circumstances for giving passes
- the responsibilities of the pass-giver and the patient to ensure the successful, magnetic action.
