## What about Earth?
Our material world, as you can read on this section of the guide, is very unique and distinct from all the Spirit dimensions. We exist as human extensions of Spirit beings, and our world is one of [trial, learning and atonements](trial-purification) of past mistakes.

Our world is an estimated 4.5 billion years old, yet only recently , 6,000 years ago, saw Humans evolve to what we are today. Of our 6,000 years on this earth an understanding of [God](/about/god) as our creator and of the basic [moral laws](/divine-laws) that we need to all share occured a very brief 2000 years ago and the discovery of our Spirit reality, the imortality of our soul, and a profoundly deeper understanding of Godâ€™s laws became a reality only 110 years ago.

We are the dominating animal on this planet but have yet to evolve beyond [war](/topics/war), [greed](/topics/greed), [cruelty](/topics/cruelty), [poverty](/topics/poverty), the destruction of our home planet and slow self-destruction. One would think that we are lost, forsaken children with little hope for long-term survival as a species. In fact our Earthly dimension is one of daily progress too, both in our intellectual growth (through science) and our ethical growth. The last is happening through religion, social progress, the new search for Spirituality so many people have embarked on and with the slowly growing worldwide belief in Spiritism.

Eventually our material earthly life will evolve and dramatically change. The spiritual ideals of middle dimensions will become a reflection of our earthly lives. Human society will change, focusing on the continued ethical progression of its inhabitance and leaving behind the materialistic driving forces of our world today. One day all diseases will have cures, there will be no poverty, no violence, people will live to very old age, most people will be active mediums, and there will be a worldwide collaboration between the Spiritual world and our material physical world.

This earthly progress is certainly far away, but the same divine laws that assure the progress of all beings also assure the progress of all worlds in the material dimension. So that beautiful future is not a remote possibility but an assured fact. It is simply a matter of how long it will take for us to go down that path.
