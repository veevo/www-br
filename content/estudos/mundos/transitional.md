## Transitional Worlds  

As a final note, in "The Spirits' Book" (Chapter X),  you will find mention of "Transitional Worlds." These are places that serve as resting places for free spirits, in the discarnate state and between incarnations. These worlds are graduated according to the needs of spirits who inhabit them.  Such spirits must have no material wants or needs. In fact, these planets' surfaces are barren (materially speaking). The spirits, however, find in the spirit realms of such planets, conditions that will help them to restore their energies, instruction, and possible permission to enter higher regions. The role of such places in the cosmos is only temporary, and in fact, the spirits tell us that the Earth, during its formation, already served in this category.
