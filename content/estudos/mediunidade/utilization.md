## Norms for the Utilization of the Mediumship
Those who are not familiar with Spiritism sometimes assume that, since we communicate with spirits, we probably use the medianimic faculty for activities such as fortune telling, working spells, interpreting dreams, or calling on deceased relatives to communicate. You will not find this sort of practice in a Spiritist Center.  Nor will you find group sessions, like those on popular TV shows, where spirits come to communicate with members of an audience. 

You can read about the seriousness and noble aims with which mediumship is practiced, among Spiritists, in the web section “Vision And Purpose" (see menu bar at left). Some of the more frequent ways in which mediumship is employed in Spiritist Centers and in the Spiritist movement are listed below.


### Dissemination
Mediumship is used by spirit authors, who, through the cooperative work of mediums, bring us their teachings, lessons, stories, and inspiring words. These mediums are able to transcribe the spirits’ words in messages that can be shared and, sometimes, in books that are published and made available to students of Spiritism.  Subsequently, those who study Spiritism and gain a solid understanding of its teachings are able to become lecturers and share the knowledge with others.

### Counseling of suffering, discarnate spirits (and associated treatment of obsessed persons)
This kind of work takes place in special sessions, sometimes referred to as the "mediumship table", where a dedicated team of mediums, counselor(s), a spiritual and an incarnate director, and pass givers, etc., meet at a regular time to make themselves available for the counseling and treatment of suffering spirits.  In such meetings, these spirits, who sometimes come on their own but who are often brought by higher order spirits, are able to communicate through the mediums, express their anguish, and receive comforting and enlightening words that help them to see things in a different perspective.  The change is not always immediate and may take multiple sessions. Often times, the work consists of convincing the perplexed entity to accept the loving hand that is extended to him or her by the good spirits who are there to help and who then take that spirit to a place in the spiritual plane for further treatment.

Gradually, the team of incarnate workers at the center, together with their partners in the spiritual plane, is able to get many spirits the help that they need.  Many times, there are additional spirits present, who have similar problems, and who are therefore brought to the session to listen to the counseling.  In this way, they are helped, indirectly, by the work that is done with the communicating spirits.

Due to the process of mental tuning, discarnate spirits and incarnate persons whose thoughts share a point of focus and vibrational frequency (determined by the moral quality of the thoughts), can enter into a mental synchronization.  If these thoughts are negative in nature, and the synchronization is frequent, the relationship that develops can and, likely, will be detrimental to both parties.  In giving in to our moral and spiritual weaknesses, then, we make ourselves susceptible to the accompaniment, and sometimes powerful influence of unhappy, spiritual companions. When intervention from outsiders becomes necessary to break the bonds of this harmful relationship, the process of treatment is similar to that described above. The spirit who is persecuting the incarnate individual receives the same kind of counseling, except that this work takes place in sessions that are dedicated to this kind of case, referred to as “obsession”, and the individual being tormented is educated regarding the moral and spiritual efforts that he must make in order to do his part in the curative process. You can read more about this influence and the counseling of spirits in the web section that discusses  obsession (see menu bar at left).

### Donation of Healthy and Restorative Energies through Fluidic Therapy
Superior spirits work with pass givers in the transmission of these energies to help restore the energies and vital centers of those who receive the treatment, in the form of passes and magnetized water. You can read more about this work in the web section on Fluidic Therapy / Magnetism (see menu bar at left).

### Medical Consultations
This is less common and only takes place in some centers where there is a spirit with the appropriate evolutionary level, as well as medical and spiritual knowledge, to prescribe an appropriate treatment for a physical illnesses. Likewise, the spirit must have a medium to work with, one who not only can tune in to this spirit, but who also has the moral character and dedication that is necessary to carry out such work. This higher spirit, acting through the medium, attends to individuals who ask for help with some physical ailment. The treatments prescribed may be, for example, a recommendation for treatment, such as passes or disobsession, suggestions for moral improvements needed on behalf of the patient, prescriptions for homeopathic medicines, etc.

### Guidance From the Center's Mentoring Spirits
The spiritual mentor(s) of a center may manifest themselves to advise workers on something that ought to be done, to call attention to a particular point, to clarify something that is in doubt, or to offer words of encouragement and support. 

### Intuitive Guidance and Support
This is a more subtle form of spiritual influence and takes place whenever someone works with love in their heart and dedicates themselves to helping others. Such people are accompanied by spirits of an elevated order, who use them as instruments in God's work, to assist individuals in need.  These spirits inspire such persons in their thoughts, words and actions, via suggestions that are registered as intuitions.

Whatever the application, the medianimic faculty is taken very seriously in the Spiritist Center, where students and workers are educated regarding the noble purpose and responsibility of such a gift, and are expected to make use of it accordingly.
