## Mediumship Education and Behavior
Education about mediumship can be found in Spiritist texts, especially in "The Medium's Book", as well as numerous other resources that provide further explanations and teachings. Students of Spiritist teachings on mediumship will learn about:

The many ways in which the beings of the material and spiritual worlds affect and communicate with one another and how to identify the different types of mediumship, from the overt communication to subtle, Spiritual influences. 

The physical and spiritual mechanisms involved in, and the factors necessary for, spirit communications.

How to remain in control, while serving as an instrument of communication.

The identification of the nature of the spirit that is communicating.  Not all spirits are ill-natured, nor are they all highly moral, the reason being that spirits are only the souls of those who once lived on Earth and who, upon disincarnation, leave behind only their material covering, but do not lose their individuality.  Therefore, the nature of the spirits is just as varied, if not more so, than the range of moral and intellectual qualities found in men on Earth.  Some spirits may reveal great truths, encourage and help us to do good, or may help us with positive solutions to our problems. Others may lie to and deceive us, encouraging us to do things that can bring harm to ourselves or others.  The danger, then, resides in trusting in all communications equally, with no regard to the moral nature and intellectual level of the communicating spirit. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for the medium to always be analytical and vigilant with regard to the quality of communications he or she is receiving.  Appropriate study will help in such analysis and in the identification of the spirit's nature. 

The influence of the medium's thoughts and actions on the type of spirits that accompany, communicate with, and influence him or her.  Herein lies the key to the medium's greatest protection against ill-willed spirits.  Natural law dictates that spirits are attracted to one another through moral and intellectual affinity.  The medium, through the nature of his or her thoughts, desires, intentions, behaviors, etc. will attract spirits of a like nature.  If the medium has good, moral thoughts and behaviors, emits positive energies, works on a continuous inner reform and desires to help others, good spirits will certainly be at his or her side, not only communicating through, but also helping to protect the medium.

Likewise, a good medium must have not only a good heart, but a great deal of humility as well, recognizing not only that he or she is only an instrument and not the source of inspiring and enlightening messages, but also the responsibility that mediumship represents and the duty that he or she has to use the mediumship accordingly; otherwise, the medium risks losing the company and aid of good-natured spirits, and sometimes his or her mediumship faculty.  To the contrary, if the medium does not work toward overcoming his or her shortcomings in patience, tolerance and forgiveness, and instead carries on with immoral thoughts and behaviors, or if he or she uses the faculty of mediumship in a self-interested way or especially with ill-willed intentions, then this medium will only attract spirits of an inferior nature, which can lead to anything from frivolous communications of no benefit to anyone, to those that are quite evil in nature, depending on the moral nature and degree of vigilance in the medium.  This can be dangerous not only to the extent of the given communication but to the possibility of strong influence, even to the point of dominance that a spirit can come to exercise over a medium who is not careful.  

Again, the key to protection from spirits of an inferior nature is continuous study and efforts toward moral reform on behalf of the medium.  This is encouraged by Spiritism and aided by the many resources available to its students.
