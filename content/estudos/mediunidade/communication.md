## How the Communication Happens
The process that takes place during an intellectual communication between the spirit and the medium involves a link between their [perispirits](/about/perispirit), so the medium can absorb its thought, through speaking or writing.

## Concepts
**Spiritual fluids (or "fluids")** are the vehicle of thought; they carry thoughts just as the air carries sound, whereby waves and rays of thoughts travel through space and cross one another without mixing.

**Fluidic Images**, created when a spirit focuses its thoughts on something, are reflected, as if photographed, in its perispirit.

**Fluids acquire their moral and physical qualities from their environment**.  As the vehicle of thought, they are imprinted with the moral qualities of the thoughts of both incarnate and discarnate spirits, which cause their degree of vibration.  Negative thoughts pollute fluids and slow the vibrations, while positive thoughts purify purify fluids and increase the vibrations.

There are two basic concepts that are key to understanding the mediumistic phenomena:

1. **The mind** is at the base of all mediumistic communications.  In all intelligent communications, the mental force of the discarnate, communicating spirit acts upon that of the incarnate medium, and in finding, in the latter, a mental passivity or receptivity (as opposed to a block or a rejection), the communication between the two will then be possible.

2. **The perispirit** is the agent of all mediumistic phenomena, "which can only be produced by the reciprocal action of the fluids that are emitted by the medium and the spirit. The development of the mediumistic faculty depends on the more or less expansive nature of the the medium's perispirit and on the greater or lesser ease of its assimilation by the spirits."  (Kardec, "Posthumous Works", #34 pg 54). 


## Fluidic Affinity
The basic process of mediumistic transmission (or tuning and capturing) involves two principal components: a fluidic affinity and a mental tuning between the spirit and the medium.

In order for spiritual manifestations to occur, both physical and intellectual, it is necessary for the perispirit of the medium to have a fluidic affinity with the perispirit of the spirit who wishes to communicate. This is the [Law of Fluidic Affinity](/divine-laws/fluidic-affinity).  

The fluidic affinity depends on the physical makeup of the medium's and the spirit's perispirits.  Therefore, mediums cannot serve as an instrument for all spirits, for some are easily compatible, and others actually repel one another.  Some mediums can only communicate with certain spirits, or certain categories of spirits.  For this reason, there could be a spirit who is unable to communicate because it does not find a medium with whom it shares a fluidic affinity.  It is also for this reason that we should be skeptical of persons that claim to be able to speak with any and all spirits.

The fluidic affinity is independent of a moral affinity; one can exist, between spirit and medium, without the other.

As a spirit approaches a medium with or through whom it wishes to communicate, it is also through this process of fluidic affinity that the medium, in agreement with his or her degree of sensitivity, may begin to feel the physical sensations that result from the influence of the spirit's vibrations.  If it is a vibration of a good or elevated spirit, i.e. harmonious and benevolent, the medium will feel a sensation of happiness and a balanced emotion that envelops him or her.  Contrarily, if the spirit is of an inferior order and thereby emits a vibration of unbalance, emotional disturbance, sickness, negativity, etc., the impressions transmitted to the medium will be unpleasant.  If the spirit has a sensation of pain, which is actually an impression from it's abandoned physical body, having no present, physical cause, the medium may capture a degree of those sensations, through vibratory tuning, but never to the extent that they are "felt" by the spirit.  It is understood, however, that what the medium feels is only a spiritual impression, and not a true physical problem of his or her own.  This impression can be controlled or lessened with proper knowledge or training, and with the help of spiritual benefactors.  Likewise, the impression normally ends with the cessation of the communication.  Should the impression linger, the medium is helped by vibrations and passes given by the other mediums attending the meeting.  

## Mental Tuning
It is through the process of mental tuning that the medium captures the thoughts and ideas of the communicating spirit, to some degree of accuracy, depending on the experience and potential of the medium, the surrounding environment, and the level of affinity between the spirit and medium.

To understand how the medium is able to capture the spirit's thoughts, remember that the perispirit of a spirit (either incarnate or discarnate) acts as a transmitter of the spirit's thoughts that, upon emission, travel through space, in waves, carried by the spiritual fluids.  In the same way, the perispirit of one spirit can act as a receiver of thought waves originating from another spirit.  Thus, the communication of spirits by way of thought takes place through the emission and reception of what spirit author, Andé Luiz refers to as "mento-electromagnetic" waves (i.e. thought-waves).

To help us understand this process, Andé Luiz provides us with the analogy of a television transmitter and receptor.   The antenna of a television station sends out, simultaneously to many locations, signals that are encoded in electromagnetic television waves, which carry images, colors, movements, and sounds that we cannot naturally perceive. These waves can, however, be captured by a TV antenna and then decoded by the television set, whereby they can be perceived and understood by human beings.  In a similar way, the medium is able to capture and decode, to some degree of accuracy, the thought waves of a communicating, discarnate spirit.  

This process can be initiated automatically, since the medium is like an antenna, more or less sensitive, capturing signals transmitted by other minds; however the process of mental tuning, in other words, the willingness of the medium to receive the message and effort to accurately transmit it, depends on the directed will of the properly educated medium, who is conscious of the spiritual influence.  This points out an important educational need that is answered by Spiritism, which teaches the conscious medium how to control his faculty so as to exercise it in the proper time and place, and helps the unconscious medium, as well as those of us without an ostensive mediumship, to recognize the signs of spiritual influence.
