## How to develop your mediumship

We sometimes hear people comment that they think they may be mediums or they want to know if they have a potential mediumship to develop, and they inquire about what they have to do to communicate with spirits.  It is important to understand that mediumship is a serious thing and should be taken seriously, with a sincere desire and commitment, together with the appropriate preparatory study.  As such, there is no one formula or book that one can follow and learn how to become a great medium. The exercise of mediumship is one activity in which the advice of that old, familiar expression, "Do not try this at home" truly should be heeded, even for experienced, developed mediums.  The study and development of mediumship should be done at a conscientious and reputable Spiritist center, where one can receive, first, the knowledgeable education in theory, followed by guidance and mentorship throughout the development and exercise of one's faculty.  

### When and Where

As stated above, the study and development of mediumship should be done at a conscientious and reputable Spiritist center.  Even if one reads many books on the subject, this does not mean that he or she is prepared to work as mediums.  The Spiritist center is a place where mediums can work together, with the support and guidance of both incarnate and discarnate instructors and mentors.  Likewise, the center, itself, works under the protection of superior spirits and is an environment very different, for example, from one's own home. 

With the exception of certain cases, a person wishing to develop his mediumship should first have the appropriate background, i.e., a basic knowledge about the Spiritism, and should then follow a course of study in mediumship, in order to have a sufficient level of knowledge with regard to theory, before seeking to put his faculty to work. This is important for the protection of all involved, but mostly for the medium himself.  In addition to having acquired an appropriate level of knowledge, it's also important for the medium to show his level of commitment to the Spiritist center in which he desires to work, by first becoming an active member, thus establishing a trusting relationship with the directors and other workers at the center, and also demonstrating the sincerity of his dedication and discipline, as well as the moral quality of his character.   

### Phases

The novice medium must understand that the development of his faculty is a process that will happen with time, demanding patience and perseverance.  The spirit author, Odilon Fernandes, reminds us that, as a sense, mediumship "continues to evolve with the spirit after death" and that "nowadays, the vast majority of Spiritist mediums are simply gathering experiences to employ in future tasks which they could be called to fulfill."  Therefore, for the medium who is just beginning to develop and use this sense, his desired results should not be expected to happen overnight.  This same author tells us about mediumship's three phases.  He writes:

"We would say that mediumship itself has three phases;  the one which appears and manifests itself in the medium; another in which it is developed; and the last one, which is the productive phase.

In the development phase, the medium should devote himself in all senses, so as to become useful to the spirits, in the productive phase.

In the productive phase, we understand that this is where the medium, who is much more secure about his mediumship, does not vacillate.  Thus, he now works as an interpreter of the spirits, being enlightened by messages from the mentors, or by spiritual communications, revealing the suffering of the communicating spirits.  From all these communications and messages, it will always be possible to us to learn about life and the laws which govern it.

The developmental phase could last many years.  It depends on the level of diligence of the medium, his dedication, his love for the work, discipline, perseverance, etc.

If the superior spirits realize that the medium is well-intentioned, then the developmental phase can be shortened.  At that time, the Superior spirits will approach him, supporting his efforts, working with him in the spirit world when his spirit disengages from his physical body by the action of sleep and, in brief, they will organize intensively his faculties.

As Allan Kardec used to say, "Impatience and an overzealous desire reveals immaturity of the medium and his lack of preparation for the task.'" 

### Affinity and Control

One part of the medium's development involves his learning to consciously tune in with the beings of the spirit realm and to become accustomed to the sensations and emotions that he will undergo as a result of the fluidic interaction between himself and the spirits, thus allowing him to act as their intermediary.  The other part, however, involves the establishment of affinity between the medium and the spirits who will work with him.  Odilon Fernandes explains that "even when it is known that such affinity existed in former lives, the affinity between spirit and medium needs time, in order to re-establish itself on a conscious level.  The spirits must know how far they can trust the medium and vice-versa."  In other words, the medium must demonstrate his level of commitment and the selfless ends for which he desires their cooperation; the medium will be tested for these and other qualities, over time, which is another reason why he must maintain a consistent level of trust, patience, and determination.  

In addition to learning how to "activate" and exercise his mediumistic faculty at the Spiritist center, the medium must also learn how to control the faculty and tune-out the attempts of some spirits' attempts to communicate through, or influence him, at times and places that are inappropriate, i.e., away from the center and outside of meetings specifically designated for working with mediumship.  Kardec writes  (“Medium’s Book, item 217): 

When a medium's faculty is developed, it must not be unduly or unwisely exercised.  The pleasure it gives to beginners sometimes excites in them an enthusiasm that needs to be moderated; they should remember that the medianimic faculty is always given for sober use, never for the satisfaction of idle curiosity.  Mediums should, therefore only use their faculty under the most favorable conditions, and not all day long.  Not having good spirits constantly at their command, the mediums run the risk, by unduly prolonging the exercise of their medianimity, of becoming the dupes of inferior ones.  It is good to have fixed days and hours for medianimic purposes because the medium then brings  a more concentrated purpose to his work, and also, because the spirits who may wish to communicate through him, being thus notified and invited beforehand, are much more likely to be present.  

### The Name vs. the Message

Too often, mediums concern themselves with the names of the spirits who communicate through their mediumship.  Spiritism teaches us an important lesson, however, which is that by giving such importance to names, one can easily fall prey to frivolous and deceptive spirits, and that it is more important to concentrate on the quality and content of the messages, through which the spirits always reveal their true nature.  Mediums can learn how to make such an analysis through the study of Spiritist texts and with the help and instruction they receive at the Spiritist center.  


### Training of the Novice Medium

Novice mediums should be aware that initially, the spirits who will work with them are very often spirits of an ordinary level of advancement, who work as what may be thought of as "training" spirits.  Just as highly-trained medical surgeons do not typically instruct first-year medical students, the superior spirits who work in mediumship-related tasks normally do not spend their time training novice mediums; instead, they leave that responsibility to the spirits of a lower rank.  For this reason, it is important for the medium to rely on the help of more experienced workers in the analysis of the messages he receives.  These spirits are not necessarily malevolent, but they do not have the level of moral or intellectual advancement that the elevated spirits have acquired. 

This is not to say, however, that novice mediums are not subject to the influence of spirits of an even lower degree.  In fact, they are particularly susceptible and must remember to be vigilant, with regard to their thoughts, in order to use the Law of Affinity to their favor. Allan Kardec writes  ("Mediums' Book", item 211):

The greatest stumbling-block for the majority of beginners is, in fact, their tendency to be drawn in to hold conversation with inferior spirits; and, usually, they may consider themselves fortunate if they only come into contact with spirits who are merely frivolous and not positively wicked.  They should do their utmost to prevent all such spirits from obtaining influence over them, for, once such spirits have been allowed to get hold of a medium, it is not always easy to get rid of them.  It is impossible to insist too strongly on the importance of such precaution, especially in the beginning, for, without it, the finest medianimic faculty may be thrown away.  


### Constructive Criticism

The medium, when receiving help, from more experienced friends and mentors, with the analysis of the communications he receives,  should never become discouraged by their constructive criticism.  A quick, defensive nature and the inability to accept such guidance is a signal of excessive pride and is not good for the medium or his group. Also, every medium must always remember that the admiration or criticism of a message's content should never be taken personally, as this content comes from the communicating spirit and not from the medium himself.
