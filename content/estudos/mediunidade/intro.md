## Introduction to Mediumship
There has always existed communication between discarnate spirits and human beings throughout history. Evidenced in the records of many cultures and in several religions, only in the mid-19th century that modern spiritualists first became aware of the existence of spirits (i.e. the continuity of life after death) and our ability to communicate with them.

The higher spirits were able to work with Allan Kardec and other collaborators to codify Spiritism through mediums and intellectual mediumship.

Today, it is also through mediumship that we continue to receive valuable instruction from our spiritual benefactors and carry out fraternal tasks of spiritual healings and treatments.  This is done in cooperation with our partners in the spiritual realm to benefit incarnate and discarnate spirits in need of guidance, education, and consolation.
