## What are the causes of Mediumship?
Mediumship is produced by both organic and spiritual causes.

As stated previously, the easy vibration of the physical medium's nervous system, by which his or her perispirit gives off a nervous-fluidic emission that is used by the spirits, serves in the production of the phenomena of physical effects. 

Likewise, the rapidity of those vibrations allows for a certain expansion and liberty of the intellectual medium's perispirit.  This expansion facilitates the connection between the perispirits of the medium and the manifesting, thereby producing the phenomena of intellectual effects.

A certain organic predisposition, one that includes a greater degree of mediumistic sensitivity and a propensity toward the above mentioned vibrations, allows for the ostensive mediumistic faculty of an individual.  Kardec writes that "...the mediumistic faculty can be developed when the [seed for this sensitivity an vibrational capacity] exists, but it can not be acquired if the seed does not exist.  This mediumistic predisposition is independent of sex, age, and temperament."   ("Posthumous Works" #33, pg 54)

The cause of mediumship is also spiritual, by definition in fact, for "without the cooperation of the spirits, mediumship would be useless, just as our eyes would be useless if there were no light". (Rigonatti)
