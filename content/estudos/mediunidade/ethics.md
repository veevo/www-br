## Ethics and Mediumship
The faculty of mediumship is used by all kinds of people, for many different purposes.  The following list outlines some key points to understanding the vision and purpose that drives the application of mediumship within the Spiritist Centers, where such mediumship is practiced under the guidelines established throughout the teachings of the higher order spirits.

·         It should first be made clear that mediumship is one thing, and Spiritism is another; they are not to be equated.  Spiritism is a scientific philosophy that serves to promote the elevation and progress of humanity.  Mediumship is a faculty that allows human beings, of any religious or spiritual belief, to channel the thoughts and ideas of the spirits.

·         In the Spiritist practice of mediumship, three principal objectives, for those of us in the material realm, are: 1) cooperation between  incarnate and discarnate beings, in the service of bringing comfort to the suffering and enlightenment to the ignorant; 2) self-education, through the renewal of sentiments, achieved through the application of moral teachings; and 3) the construction of precious ties of affection with the spiritual plane, thereby consolidating the bases of superior cooperation and friendship.   ("Studying Mediumship", Ch XXIX)

·         In addition to the objectives above, another application of mediumship, which falls under the umbrella of practical Spiritism, is the collection of scientific investigations related to matters of the spirit.  After all, Spiritism is both a philosophy and a science.  As the spiritual assistant Aulus, in the book "In the Domain of Mediumship",by Spirit author, Andre Luiz, says, "The laborious efforts of science are just as holy as the heroism of faith. Intelligent study, with its balances and beakers, also works to serve the Lord.  By investigating and recording mediumistic phenomena, science will be one day register psychic vibrations, thus guaranteeing the dignity of religion in the new era."

·         The ultimate goal of mediumistic work, in the Spiritist view, is of a very lofty nature.  Spiritist mediums view their faculty as a gift from God that should be used, in cooperation with Jesus and the higher spirits, to help their brothers and sisters, both discarnate and incarnate. 

·         Spiritism teaches us about the seriousness of the work involved in mediumship and, consequently, of the moral and disciplinary responsibilities of the medium who wants to have the guidance, cooperation, and protection of good spirits.  Mediums who are true students of Spiritism and who are dedicated to their work, heed these lessons and strive toward behaviors, both in and out of the Spiritist center, that reflect their understanding of these responsibilities. (see "Necessary Virtues" on menu bar at left)

·         "Give for free what you receive for free" is a moral maxim of Jesus, respected by Spiritists in the practice of mediumship. Like other works of compassion and assistance that are carried out at Spiritist centers, the fraternal assistance and educational opportunities afforded by mediumistic exchange are always carried out free of charge by Spiritist centers and their workers.  As humble workers of the lord, Spiritist mediums recognize that they serve only as instruments for the spirits with whom they collaborate in tasks of benevolent purpose. Respecting the higher spirits with whom they desire to work, seeking not to exploit them for financial gain or with requests of inferior or material concern, and likewise recognizing that mediumship is a gift given freely by God, Spiritist centers do not put a price on the assistance, collaboration, and goodwill of their spiritual mentors and work partners.  

·         It should be pointed out that an integral part of the Spiritist vision of mediumship is the education of its students, regarding the roles that the superior spirits play in carrying out the work at mediumship sessions.  Just as the mediums have more responsibilities than merely showing up at the given time and fulfilling their role as channels for the spiritual realm, the spirits, themselves, have roles much greater than just appearing and fulfilling their end of the mediumistic exchange. In studying the books of Spiritism, such as those by spirit author, Andre Luiz, we learn more about the involvement of the superior spirits in the Spiritist Center's work.  We discover the extent of their efforts, before, during, and after the mediumistic tasks are carried out, the objective being to ensure, as much as possible, the protection and success of the work.  As one delves deeper into the wealth of knowledge that Spiritism has to offer on this subject, one cannot help but feel an even greater sense of admiration and respect for the organization and loving dedication of our brothers and sisters in the spirit realm. 

·         Lastly, though some may, presently, have a much more ostensive mediumship than others, the lessons to be learned, ones that result from the serious employment of this faculty, are open and applicable to all who believe.  Spirit author, Odilon Fernandez, writes, "The spiritual messages that come from mediumship, inviting man to an inner renovation, frequently have the mission of awakening the consciences of those who persist in making errors." These messages are very important for us, for as this same author adds, "So far, the biggest challenge for the incarnate spirit is not to believe that life goes on after the death of the physical body, but to live in this world with the sense of eternity."
