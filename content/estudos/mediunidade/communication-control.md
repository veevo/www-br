## Controlling the Communication
The subsection entitled "Speaking and Writing Mediums" talks about the fluidic cord that links the mind of the manifesting spirit with the perispiritic mind of the medium, and then the latter with the medium's physical body. This chord carries the thoughts and impulses of the manifesting spirit to the physical body of the medium, where they are then registered, consciously or unconsciously, by the medium, depending on the type of mediumship he possesses.

The teachers of Spiritism explain that, regardless of the degree of consciousness of the medium, he has not only the ability, but also the responsibility to exercise control over the words and actions of the communicating spirit, especially in the case of the speaking medium.  This should be done both for the protection of the medium as well as for the preservation of a harmonious environment in which the session is being held. 

A medium's moral state is very important for attracting the presence and communications of good and elevated spirits.  This holds true with respect to any kind of mediumistic session, for the mediums always benefit from the assistance of these benevolent friends and work partners.  However, there are times when, even though these higher spirits are present, it is not the main objective of the session to receive their communications.  This occurs in mediumistic sessions that are held to offer counseling and comfort to suffering spirits, as well as angry and vengeful ones, whereby the mediums, though never changing their own moral state, open their minds and hearts to allow these spirits to use them as an intermediary. 

In the above mentioned sessions, or in any session or circumstance where the medium, for whatever reason, allows a spirit who is emotionally charged with unhealthy, negative sentiments to communicate, there is a possibility for such a spirit to act or speak out in ways that are very offensive, sometimes even violent and, consequently, disrespectful to the medium who has offered the use of his or her physical body.  The medium must always remember that, while he may temporarily loan his body to a spirit for use in communication, he is, at all times, the owner of that body and, therefore, has the right and responsibility to cut off the communication at any time, or at least limit the verbal and physical use of his body, should the spirit attempt to behave in such a manner.  Proof of the medium's ability to control the communication in this way can be observed in the revolt expressed by a spirit who complains against the restriction or the apparent "imprisonment".    

### Control in the Unconscious Medium

Perhaps wonder how a medium of the unconscious type is able to willingly exercise control over a spirit's communication.  You may recall Kardec's words when he said that "the medium is passive when he does not mingle his own ideas with those of the communicating spirit, but he is  never an absolute nullity."  We can find a more detailed explanation in the book, "In the Domain of Mediumship”, where we learn that the well-developed and morally fit medium, even while appearing unconscious on the exterior, is still able to control the spirit's use of his body.  This is because, in the depths of his being, such a medium possesses the positive moral qualities of his own inalienable and irreversible achievement that serve to impede the communicating spirit from exerting an undignified communication.  The spirit, aggressive and rebellious as it may be, finds itself controlled in every expression by the superior mind and the constricting mental energies to which it is subordinated.  This type of communication represents a situation in which the elevated moral capacity and mediumistic development of the medium is of absolute necessity to allow for a safe and controlled communication.  An unconscious psycophony, in the hands of someone less prepared, can have very dangerous effects, in general, but, more specifically, can lead to a disastrous, negative control over the medium.   In serious and responsible Spiritist centers, where workers and coordinators earn and count on the assistance of elevated spirits, the latter only permit the exercise of unconscious psycophony is only permitted with mediums that can handle the nature of the particular spirit who is to communicate.

In exercising proper control over spirit communications, the first responsibility lies with the medium, as the owner of the body being used by the spirit. In addition, however, the meeting's incarnate counselor and its guardian or mentoring spirits, as well as the rest of the participants in the session, also have the responsibility to help the medium to successfully carry out his or her task, through a concentrated and united effort in thought and prayer.
