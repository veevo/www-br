## Fraud in Mediumship 
Some skeptics or critics are weary of the practice of mediumship because they are very suspicious of fraud, either in the manifestation itself or in the identification of a spirit who is said to have communicated.   We must be rational here and understand that just as there are deceptive people in all walks of life and all kinds of activities, they are at play in the practice of mediumship as well.  Some are not mediums at all and seek only to put on a show or to make a dollar at someone else's expense.  Others may actually be mediums but may use their abilities inappropriately or even mix truth with untruth out of self interest.  Likewise, deceit can originate from both the medium and the communicating spirits.  Even when the faculty is legitimate, if he/she is not careful, any true medium can be duped by a dishonest spirit.   

Spiritism teaches us how to do our part to protect against the fraudulent practices and deceitful communications.  Trustworthy, Spiritist mediums:

work without self-interest and with the intension of helping others.

do not charge for their assistance, for they work with humility and recognize that they are merely acting as an instrument in the aid given to whomever being helped.

are taught how to protect against the negative or deceitful influence of spirits, or of those who may try to lead them astray. 

seek, through their own study and moral efforts, to work with higher spirits whose communications are characterized by seriousness and compassion, with the ultimate purpose of contributing to the moral and spiritual progression of humanity.

use no "aids" such as crystal balls, tarot cards, tea leaves, Ouiji Boards, etc., which are unnecessary to the communications and do not attract serious spirits.   

do not guarantee communication with any spirit, for they know that (1) spirits communicate at will and according to their conditions at that given time and (2) that a vibrational affinity between the spirit and the medium is necessary to the communication; this affinity is very specific and without it, communications are incomplete, false, or impossible.  In addition, such affinity is often developed over time and is rarely complete from the beginning.  

Finally, Spiritism teaches us that we should always hold spirit communications to the tests of rationality, integrity, and compatibility with natural law, as well as to the moral teachings of Jesus and the superior spirits.
