### Item #159
> "Everyone who is, to any degree, influenced by spirits is, by that very fact, a medium.  This faculty is inherent in man, and is therefore no exclusive privilege;  therefore, rare are those who do not possess some rudiments of the faculty.  We may, therefore, assume that everyone is more or less a medium."  

Allan Kardec, "The Mediums' Book", item #159
