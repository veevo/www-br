## Concepts
 The Mediums Book repeats and amends to many of the concepts of the Spirits book. Below are a few of the ones unique to this book.

The Perispirit: The Perispirit, a semi-material envelope part of the ‘spirit’. The perispirit is the part of the spirit that can be modified and changed in order for a spirit to be able to act upon its environment. The term Perispirit is from the Greek, meaning Outer Spirit or Around the Spirit. The perispirit has roughly the same appearance of the spirits’ last incarnation and is what we actually see in apparitions.

Poltergeists: The perturbation popularly named poltergeist is caused by an ignorant spirit taking advantage of an untrained natural medium. If the medium learns how to control his/her gift he will not be disturbed by it. Sometimes the medium loses his/her gift after puberty.

Mind over matter: Spirits are capable of moving, transporting, dematerialising and rematerialising inanimate objects, with the help of mediums by using a substance called ectoplasm.

Sleep is the emancipation of the mind: While we are asleep our spirit loosens its ties to the material body and wanders the spiritual world. Because of it, it is theoretically possible — although uncommon — to see the spirit of a living person as an apparition. Sometimes though, it is just an illusion: Kardec admits that often people who report apparitions or poltergeist are victims of delusion, hallucination or are just lying.

The spiritual world is a mirror of the material world, except for the lower spirits (for whom it is something not unlike hell) or the higher ones (for whom it is ideal, immaterial).

Haunted houses are haunted all the time, not only at night: But it is much easier to hear and to see spirits when it is quiet and dark.

Because spirits are of varied degrees of knowledge and ethical development, their communications are also diverse. Only a small portion of the communications are worth keeping record of. The only way for a medium to select the quality of communication is by sympathy: spirits are attracted or repelled by similar tastes, so each medium will attract spirits that share his interests or know his weaknesses.

There are different types of mediums, as many as the different types of phenomena spirits can produce. The most common types are: physical effects, seer, hearer, psychographer, sensitive, incorporative (talkative), sleepwalking, healer and intuitive.

Mediumship can be tiring, painful or even downright dangerous to the health of the body or of the mind. That is why the education and ethical advancement of a medium is critical to the use of the ability.

Uneducated, unethical, ignorant mediums are under the risk of allowing themselves to be overwhelmed by equally ignorant spirits, this is called obsession. The only way to prevent this is for a medium to be educated and strive to lead an ethical life.

Mediums cannot produce phenomena at will, only when some spirit is willing too.

Animals are mediums too: they can see spirits and hear them.
