## What is Spiritism?

A work that is still up-to-date, What is Spiritism? is useful for adherents of Spiritism as well as for those who want to understand the nature of the Spiritist Doctrine and its fundamental points. Allan Kardec’s impeccable logic and rationale are patent in this book as he confounds detractors of Spiritism with his answers to the questions of those who believe in and aspire to a superior life.

The book is divided into three chapters. The first is composed of separate dialogues between Allan Kardec and a critic, a skeptic, and a priest. The dialogues provide answers to those who do not yet understand the basic principles of Spiritism and it is a formidable introduction to Spiritism. In addition, it also presents appropriate refutations to the opponents of Spiritism. The second chapter presents practical and experimental aspects of the science and is a very concise summary of The Mediums’ Book, the second book of the Spiritist Codification. The third chapter is a short synthesis of The Spirits’ Book, with solutions to psychological, moral, and philosophical problems as they are analysed and interpreted according to Spiritism.

The book is prefaced with an abridged version of Henri Sausse’s biography of Allan Kardec.
