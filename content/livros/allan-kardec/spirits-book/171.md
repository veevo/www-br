## 171. What is the basis for the doctrine of reincarnation? 
> "The justice of God, and revelation. As we've said already, a loving parent always leaves the door of forgiveness open to straying children. Doesn't reason convince you that it would be unjust to withhold happiness eternally from spirits who haven't had the chance to improve themselves? All of us are God's children.  Injustice, unrelenting hatred, everlasting punishments are concepts you find among self-centered and less advanced humans, but not in God."
