### Question 135 - Is there anything in human beings besides a soul and a body?
> "Yes, there is the link by which the soul and the body are connected." 

### Question 135a - Can you describe this link?
> "It is semi-material.  In other words, it is, by nature, midway between soul and body.  Without it, soul and body could not communicate with each other.  This is, in fact, the purpose of the link; it enables the spirit to act on matter and matter to act on the spirit."
