## The Spiritist Review

The Spiritist Review was written and published by Allan Kardec from January 1858 to April 1869. In total there are 136 monthly issues of the Review, bundled in volumes of 12 issues per year, yielding 12 volumes. It is the largest Spiritist production of Allan Kardec. In addition to the profound study of the Spiritist theory and the explanations about several questions raised by the Spiritists, the Review shows the evolution of Kardec’s thought during the construction of the Spiritist Science. While complementing the two main books of the Spiritist Doctrine, The Spirits’ Book and The Mediums’ Book, and showing their most important applications, the Review is indispensable to all those willing to have an in-depth understanding of Kardec’s thoughts.
