## Description
This book is one of the five basic works that make up the Codification of Spiritism.  Its overall scope is to explain the justice of God in the light of the Spiritist Doctrine and  to demonstrate the immortality of the soul and its condition in the spirit world as a consequence of its own acts while incarnate in the physical world.

The work is divided into two parts:

The first part examines various ideas concerning life after death: the purely materialist view of nothingness, the idea of absorption into the Universal Whole, and pantheism.  It also provides a portrayal of the classic pagan view of Tartarus and shows how the traditional Church doctrine of hell is a reflected intensification of the pagan doctrine.  Furthermore, it explains how the Churchâ€™s doctrine fails in light of the scientific view of the cosmos and a rational understanding of the justice of God.  It deals with a gauntlet of problems that only immortality of the soul and reincarnation can explain satisfactorily.  The author seeks to clarify topics such as angles, heaven, demons, hell, purgatory, the fear of death, the Mosaic prohibition against evoking the dead, etc.  He also defends the Spiritist stance against the doctrine of eternal punishment. 

The second part is a collection of actual communications by happy, average and suffering spirits as well as repentant criminals, hardened spirits, and suicides.  They themselves describe what they experienced at the moment of death and what they are experiencing right now in the afterlife.
