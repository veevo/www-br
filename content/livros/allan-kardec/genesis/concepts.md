## Concepts
Upon death, the Spirit is compelled to face an overview of their past existence. Coming to terms with those he/she has harmed or helped. And becoming clearly aware of what personal changes are needed for the next stage of their evolution.

Spirits of different levels of evolution will find themselves in different dimensions in the spirit world. Each corresponding to the basic characteristics of its inhabitence.

A spirits in the lower dimensions will remain in these dimensions until they realize that they must change and ask God for help. At that moment Spirit friends from higher dimensions will take the Spirit to a place of rest and recuperation until they can be taken to their new higher dimension.

Some low level Spirits who have just passed on have no idea that they have even died. While others clearly understand their conditions but stubbornly refuse to change.

Spirits in lower levels who are very stubborn are some times routinely reminded by higher level Spirits of what joy and healing can come with trying to change.

Their is no ‘hell’ or ‘devil’, the lower dimensions of the Spirit world are places of violence, cruelty and chaos but only because it’s inhabitence choose to make it so.

Because of the “Law of Progress” even the most stubborn Spirit will eventually choose to change.

Many spirits who have recently passed on and lived what they believed to be ethical lives are shocked to realize that by choosing not to actively help others and perform acts of charity that they have mis-spent the precious opportunity to grow and progress on Earth and have not progressed since their last reincarnation.

Not all Spirits are aware of their past lives, such knowledge is stored in their subcontious. For Low Level Spirits such knowledge remains hidden until they choose to better themselves, and Spirit guides can supervise the process of remembering.

Spirits tend to reincarnate among the same group of people repeatedly. This reflects the lasting nature of the bonds of family and friendship and the fact that many of the debts needed to be repaied in many reincarnations are to family and friends.

Upon desincarnation a Spirit tends to keep the appearence, voice and personality they had before death until their next reincarnation
