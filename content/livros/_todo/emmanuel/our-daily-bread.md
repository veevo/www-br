This book is part of an outstanding collection, which includes: The Way, the Truth and the Life, Living Spring, and Vineyard of Light.  The collection was written by the spirit Emmanuel, who seeks to guide Spiritists in the practice of Christian principles, leading them to find in the teachings of Jesus their inner transformation, which cannot be postponed. 

In the book’s 180 chapters, the author brilliantly comments on several verses from the New Testment.  From each page spring the depth of concept and the lightness of form in which they are outlined.

The spirit author shows Spiritism duly based on the lessons of the New Testament as being an opportunity for work and growth for those who long for the renewal of their minds.

Our Daily Bread is nourishment for the spirit, strengthening it for its daily struggles.
