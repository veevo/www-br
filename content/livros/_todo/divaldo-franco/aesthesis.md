The spirit Rabindranath Tagore returns after his discarnation with the same lyricism and poetry, as evidenced in the psychographed work Aesthesis:
>"Immortal, before time and beyond eras, I bow down at the window of eternity so that the magic of Your work unites me ever more with You, intoxicating me with happiness…"

>"Wordly richness weighs down on he who possesses it, forcing him lower. The treasure of love lifts him up to fly, free and happy, up the gully of infinity."
