The faculty of mediumship, with its various manifestations, has been the dominant factor in proving the reality of the afterlife and the transcendental nature of the universe. Through this faculty, a multitude of phenomena has been witnessed, demonstrating to the astonishment of many that intelligence is not merely a product of brain cells.

Among the several types of mediumship known today, psychography is the most often used within Spiritism, especially for the writing of books and messages.

André Luiz’ purpose in writing this book was to recruit new groups of workers of goodness, whose intent is to aid in the readjustment of those no longer in the physical plane and who have become distanced from reality. There is nothing more appropriate and just for if ignorance needs the dedication of teachers, and psychopathology awaits the abnegation of doctors who use of techniques of balanced dialogue in the practice of psychoanalysis, so it is that mental alienation of the discarnate beings demands the fraternal assistance of friendly hearts with enough understanding and an abundance of love to aid them at spiritist centers.

Through the work of several collaborators, this volume is an important synthesis in the effort to aid those suffering from obsessive processes. It is characterized by its absolute simplicity in the explanation of the circumstances that are indispensable for the constitution and maintenance of spiritist groups, which are devoted to the liberation and healing task of disobsession.
