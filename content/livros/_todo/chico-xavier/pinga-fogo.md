This special two-DVD edition with English subtitles retrieves the historic program Pinga-Fogo with Francisco Xavier, a veritable milestone of the Brazilian Spiritist Movement. It brings more than two hours of extra footage with interviews, documentaries, and bonus information.
On the evenings of July 28 and December 21 in 1971, the broadcast corporation TV Tupi, channel 4 of São Paulo presented in their news program Pinga-Fogo—loosely translated into "On the line of Fire"—the spiritist medium Francisco Xavier answering questions from news reporters Saulo Gomes, Reali Jr., Helle Alves, and Herculano Pires; the catholic intellectual João de Scantimburgo, and scientist Dr. Hernani Guimarães Andrade.

In those two programs, Francisco Xavier left teachings for millions of individuals from all social and cultural standings concerning the biggest questions in life such as whom we are and where we go after death of the physical body, among many other topics.

During the interviews, Francisco Xavier also discussed the following topics: collective deaths, communication with departed relatives, the moment of death, plastic surgery, cremation, the death penalty, Emmanuel (his spiritual guide) and the priest Manoel da Nóbrega, cryopreservation of the physical body, family planning, abortion, organ transplantation, spiritual materializations, spiritual censorship, psychography, double sight, spiritual surgeries, catholic psychography, the question "Are spiritists conformists?," contact with other planets, the arrival of men on the moon, marriage and divorce, reincarnations, free sex, homosexuality, weapons of mass destruction, and the Vietnam war.

The bonus footage includes: the news reporter and the medium, the great surprise to all news reporters, the emotion 35 years later, the importance of the program Pinga Fogo, remembering Francisco Xavier, honoring Francisco Xavier, and Francisco Xavier—A Story of Love. It also features interviews with other members of the Brazilian spiritist movement such as Francisco Galves, Nena Galves, Dr. Tuffik Mattar, Dr. Marlene Nobre, and Zita Ghilardi.
