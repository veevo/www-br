In this volume, André Luiz focuses on aspects of life in the spirit world and the communication between discarnates and incarnates, especially during the sleep of the physical body.

The spiritual author explains the causes of mental disturbances and presents their respective spiritual treatments.

In the form of a novel, he also analyzes topics such as abortion, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and Down syndrome, and highlights the immediate rescue given the invisible workers to those who need help in order to avoid, as much as possible, madness, suicide, and extreme moral disasters.
