This book is a compilation of messages originally published in the Brazilian newspaper “O Diário de São Paulo.” They were later collected for publication as a set of four books.

Each message is the result of a partnership between two of the greatest names in spiritist literature, Francisco Cândido (Chico) Xavier and Prof. José Herculano Pires. The present work has a significant historic value in that it brings together these two great contributors of the spiritist literature for the first time.
