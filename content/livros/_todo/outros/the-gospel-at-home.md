## Description
This book works as a study companion for those seeking direction in their practice of the Gospel At Home.  It includes passages from "The Gospel Explained By The Spiritist Doctrine" (written by Kardec, who, in turn, includes passages from the New Testament) and offers suggested questions for you and your family members to ponder, ones that may spark discussion on a particular interpretation or application of the lesson under study.  It is especially helpful for those who are new to the Spiritist Doctrine and the practice of Gospel At Home or for families with young children, as it helps to engage the children in the family discussion.
