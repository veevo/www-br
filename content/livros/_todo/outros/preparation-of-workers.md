## Description
With these texts, we intend to collaborate with the efforts of all Spiritist Institutions and fellow Spiritists, especially those associated with the work of unification of the Spiritist Movement and in the preparation and integration of new participants in the noble activities related to the study, dissemination, and practice of the Spiritist Doctrine.

This work also has the purpose of collaborating in the efforts of making the work of unification of the Spiritist Movement better known and better understood, facilitating, therefore, the process of integration and union of the workers and of the Spiritist institutions.  This is crucial for a more adequate dissemination of the Spiritist Doctrine, insomuch as providing a permanent support for the activities conducted by the Spiritist groups, centers, and societies.
