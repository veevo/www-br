## Description
A Heart searches for an owner in a land where most have forgotten what it’s like to be human.  To anyone who is open, the Heart offers the chance to feel and to love.

But the search is difficult.  The Heart encounters a Calculator Man who cares only about numbers, a Poet who runs from love, a Dictator who cannot surrender control, and a TV Producer who wants to make the Heart a “sensation.”

A Heart Alone in the Land of Darkness is a story about compassion and tolerance.  It offers a universal theme for children and adults.
