## Description
Short story, written by the discarnate spirit of the well-known, Swedish author, dictated to Divaldo Franco, during his journey across Europe in 1994.

The theme of the lecture in Stockholm, Sweden, on the 11th of June, was “Reincarnation, the Law of Love and Diseases.”  Our spiritual friends brought forth the venerated short-story author, Selma Lagerlof, to communicate by psychography, and she offered the beautiful and delicate pages presented here.
