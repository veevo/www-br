Five people, who devoted their entire lives to the practice of good, are at the end of their physical existences. Due to their merit, they have the help of a spirit rescue team. The spirit Andre Luiz tells about his experience as a member of such a team. This is an enthralling narrative that reveals details of the tasks performed by spirits at the moment of the death of the physical body.

In this book, Andre Luiz confirms the principles revealed by the Spiritist Doctrine regarding the existence of the spirit world, where discarnate spirits dwell, living a new life while preparing to return once again to the earthly journey.

> “…Death does not extinguish friendly cooperation, mutual support, comforting intercession or the evolutionary endeavor.  The vibratory dimensions of the universe are infinite as are the worlds that populate the immensity of space.”
