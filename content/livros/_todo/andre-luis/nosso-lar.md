The former physician André Luiz's articulate and compelling reporting reads more like a novel than the detailed, compelling document of after-life existence that it is.  Rarely does one find information about the after-life that is both inspirational and informative - but such is the case here.

The extensive tour that constitutes "Nosso Lar - A Spiritual Home" contains those benchmarks of the after-life familiar to us all; a gate, the light, helpers and splendors.  But these are minor details, it turns out, in  an elaborate journey through a complex, well-organized universe, containing many spiritual levels that, in turn, constitute this spiritual Colony.

By being given the rare privilege of joining Luiz's journey from what we think to be the safe side, we are given important lessons for our earthly lives that embrace issues of service, love, responsibility, marriage, reunion, return, and so much more.

We live much of our lives in fear of what awaits us and our loved ones after death.  Few religious, philosophical, or spiritual systems of note offer us the detailed descriptions coupled with the wisdom and compassion that we so greatly need.  This book not only renders information, but it gives us that most precious of all energies with which to maximize this life as well as the journey beyond.  "Nosso Lar" gives us Hope.
