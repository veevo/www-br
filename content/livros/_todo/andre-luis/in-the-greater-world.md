In this volume, Andre Luiz focuses on aspects of life in the spirit world and the communication between discarnates and incarnates, especially during the sleep of the physical body.

The spirit author explains the causes of mental disturbances and presents their respective spiritual treatments.

In the form of a novel, he also analyzes topics such as abortion, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and Downs Syndrome and highlights the immediate rescue given by invisible workers to those who need help in order to avoid - as far as possible – madness, suicide and extreme moral disasters.
