## Description
The Genesis: Miracles and Predictions Explained by the Spiritist Doctrine (La Genèse: Les Miracles Et Les Prédictions Selon Le Spiritisme in the original French) was published 1868, just before Kardec’s death. This volume divided into three main sections, not just tries to find common ground between science and religion, and dispel the myth of miracles (the supernatural), but also delvs into important scientific and philosophical topics within Spitritism.

This is the 5th and last book in the codification of the Spiritist Doctrine.  It is divided into 3 major parts:

### Part One - Genesis
This part deals with subjects in spiritisim such as God, good , evil, and the Spiritist view of the biblical genesis. Subjects of science as understood in 1868, relating to the origins of the universe, ancient and modern systems of the world, a study of space and time, geologic design of the Earth, theories about the Earth’s formation, global revolutions, organic genesis, and spiritual genesis.

### Part Two - Miracles
This part shows how previously inexplicable (and therefore referred to as miraculous) phenomena are actually natural occurrences governed by little-known, yet natural laws.  It covers topics such as: the characteristics of "miracles", spiritual fluids and their role in such phenomena, and the miracles of the Gospel.

### Part Three - Predictions
This part discusses premonitions of future events, the predictions of the Gospel, and the implications of the coming evolutionary transition of the Earth.

In spite of the fact that the Spirit Teachers, like with other revelations in history, were tempered by the very limited scientific understandings of the era, much of what was revealed to Kardec in 1868 predicts later scientific discoveries:

> … it is astonishing how few of the spirits’ ‘scientific’ statements appear anachronistic today. In fact, some of the answers to Rivail’s questions could be interpreted as being remarkably ahead of their time. One such example was Rivail’s question ‘Does an absolute void exist in any part of space?’ which received the reply:- ‘No, there is no void. What appears like a void to you is occupied by matter in a state in which it escapes the action of your senses and of your instruments.’ This statement (given in the 1860’s), to the effect that seemingly empty space is really full of matter, has only received confirmation quite recently by the discovery of what is termed the ‘quantum vacuum’, and was given shortly after the spirits had also casually announced that ‘…what you term a molecule [or, perhaps, ‘particle’ or ‘atom’] is still very far from being the elementary molecule’. This latter scientific fact would not be confirmed until J.J. Thomson discovered the electron almost half a century later. “
