## Genesis - Chapter 14, Item 11
>"In the same way that fish can not live in the air, that Earthly animals can not live in an atmosphere with air too thin for their lungs, the inferior spirits can not withstand the brilliance and impression made by the most ethereal of fluids.  They would not die in an environment with such fluids, because spirits do not die, but an intensive force keeps them away, just as an earthly being moves away from a very hot fire or a blinding light. <br><br>
>This is why spirit can not leave an environment appropriate for their nature; to leave a very material environment, they need to first change their nature, by ridding themselves of the material instincts that hold them there, in other words, that they purify themselves through a moral transformation. Through such a transformation, they will gradually identify with purer environments that become a necessity to them, as eyes ̶  for someone who lived a long time in the darkness ̶  naturally become accustomed to the light of day and the brilliance of the sun."  <br><br>
> Allan Kardec
