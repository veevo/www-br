## Description

The Gospel according to Spiritism is the third of the five books that compromise the [Spiritist Codification](/spiritism/codification), a compilation of teachings transmitted by high order spirits (the Spirits) and organized and commented on by [Allan Kardec](/profiles/allan-kardec).

The book contains the essence of the moral teachings of Jesus, thus providing a roof under which followers of all religions- even those who profess no religion at all- can gather, for it offers a sure guide for our inner reforms, which, according to Christ, is indispensable for the spirit on its evolutionary journey to God only by complying fully with the divine laws.
