## Description
The Mediums’ Book is the second of the five volumes comprising the [Codification](/spiritism/codification) fo the [Spiritist Doctrine](/spiritism). This book explains how and in what ways spirits manifest themselves in the physical world and how to test them to determine if they of God.

The Mediums’ Book is indispensable reading and provides priceless advice to Spiritists.  It will always be a precious source of knowledge for any person who inquires into and considers the mediumistic phenomenon that has increasingly manifested itself throughout the world within or apart from formal Spiritist activities. 

Since we human beings are in integral part of the interchange between the physical and the spirit planes of life, it is best we understand the mechanisms of this relationship as much as possible. 

The Mediums’ Book is the safest manual for all those who dedicate themselves to activities involving communication with the spirit world.

## Author Notes
Allan Kardec describes the book (La Revue Spirite, from 1861) as follows: 
> "It constitutes the complement to "The Spirits' Book" and contains the experimental piece of Spiritism, just as the latter contains the philosophic piece.  In this work, fruit of a long experience of laborious studies, we sought to clarify all the questions tied to the practice of the manifestations.  In agreement with the Spirit teachings, it contains the theoretic explanation of the diverse phenomena and of the conditions in which they are produced.  But the section pertaining to the development and exercise of mediumship was, on our part, a topic of particular attention and focus."
