				<p>The Spitits' Book is divided in 4 parts (or books).</p>
				

				<h3>Book One</h3>
				<p>Untitled, this book deals with the origins of the universe and the attributes of God.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Chapter 1 (God) is intented to clarify the true essence of God.</li>
					<li>Chapter 2 (General Elements of the Universe) explains the difference between spiritual and material matter and why spirits are not believed by materialists.</li>
					<li>Chapter 3 (Vital Principle) is about the differences between animate and inanimate beings, between the living and the dead and the features of intelligence compared to instinct.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Book Two - The Spirit-World</h3>
				<p>This book describes spiritual life</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Chapter 1 (Spirits) explains what spirits are, where they come from, what they are like, how they manifest, the purpose of their existence, and how people perceive them.</li>
					<li>Chapter 2 (Incarnation of Spirits) is about why spirits incarnate in material bodies.</li>
					<li>Chapter 3 (Return from Corporeal Life to Spirit Life) is about disincarnation (death).</li>
					<li>Chapter 4 (Plurality of Existences) is about reincarnation.</li>
					<li>Chapter 5 (Considerations on the Plurality of Existences) is an essay by Kardec meant to clarify the doctrine of the previous chapter.</li>
					<li>Chapter 6 (Spirit Life) describes what exists in the afterlife, the spiritual world.</li>
					<li>Chapter 7 (Return to Corporeal Life) explains how and when spirits come back to life by literally being born again.</li>
					<li>Chapter 8 (Emancipation of the Soul) is about situations in which the spirit of a living person may be free to interact with the spirits of the dead, as in near death experiences or during a deep sleep. This chapter does not cover waking mediumship.</li>
					<li>Chapter 9 (Intervention of Spirits in the Material World) is about situations in which the spirits of the dead may, ostensibly or not, intentionally or not, have any form of influence on events of the living world.</li>
					<li>Chapter 10 (Occupations and Missions of the Spirits) is an essay by Kardec on the different reasons why high spirits interfere with the world.</li>
					<li>Chapter 11 (The Three Reigns) is about the differences between inanimate beings (mineral), plants, and animals and contains the standard spiritist doctrine on Metempsychosis.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Book Three - Moral Laws</h3>
				<p>contains what Kardec regarded as the kernel of his doctrine, the special and fair (in his view) moral laws that provided explanations and consoled people in moments of anger or grief. Such laws were actually the following.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Divine Law</li>
					<li>The Law of Adoration</li>
					<li>The Law of Labour</li>
					<li>The Law of Reproduction</li>
					<li>The Law of Preservation</li>
					<li>The Law of Destruction</li>
					<li>Social Law</li>
					<li>The Law of Progress</li>
					<li>The Law of Equality</li>
					<li>The Law of Liberty</li>
					<li>The Law of Justice, Love and Charity</li>
					<li>Moral Perfection</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Book Four - Hopes and Consolations</h3>
				<p>Is about the most common doubts people have about religion in general and tries to solve the most sensitive ones under new light.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Chapter 1 (Earthly Joys and Sorrows) is about the meaning of the experiences we have on Earth, both good and bad.</li>
					<li>Chapter 2 (Future Joys and Sorrows) is about the laws governing the future lives we are bound to live after we die.</li>
				</ul>
