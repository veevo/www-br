## About the book
This book of questions and answers is the first book of the Spiritist Doctrine that resulted from Allan Kardec's work in comparing and analyzing numerous messages from different spirits, through various mediums, finally compiling this collection of information received from superior spirits and publishing it under their directive (see our History section for more information).  

This book lays out the basic philosophic principles of the Spiritist Doctrine, teaching us about the immortality of the soul, the nature of the spirit and the incorporeal world, the relationship between the material and spiritual worlds, the moral laws, the present life, and the future of humanity.

### Author Notes
This is not a personal work of Allan Kardec, who says himself in the prologue:
> "The Spirits tell us that the time appointed by Providence for a universal recognition of their existence has now come.  They have stated that their mission, as messengers and instruments of God, is to inaugurate a new era of regeneration for the human race. This book is a compilation of their teachings. It has been written at the request and under the dictation of advanced spirits for the purpose of establishing a rational philosophy, free from prejudices and pre-conceived notions. It contains nothing that is not the expression of the Spirits' thought and that has not been submitted to their approval."

After you have read The Spirits’ Book, you will no longer have any reason to fear death.  The Spirits’ Book will provide you with the answers to nearly all the questions you may have with regards to the origin, nature and destiny of each and every soul on Earth – and those of other worlds as well. It also addresses the issues of God, creation, moral laws and the nature of spirits and their relationships with humans.
