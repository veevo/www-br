In this book, the spiritual mentor, André Luiz, presents the basic guidelines for the Spiritist mediumship session that is held for the loving and dedicated rescue work of disobsession.  He outlines the flow of events, before, during, and after the session, discusses the various members of the work team and their roles, and offers sound advice regarding the sense of care and responsibility with which each participant, as well as the group as a whole, should carry out their tasks.

This is a must read for anyone who wishes to participate in this kind of mediumistic work, and a recommended reading for anyone who wishes to learn more about mediumship and the work of Spiritist Centers.
