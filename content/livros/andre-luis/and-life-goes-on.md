This inspirational novel by André Luiz, physician and poet, who writes through the pen of Francisco C. Xavier, gently awakens us to the rich meaning of life, friendship, and love.  In it, we find that life is a journey on which we add to and recreate our innermost selves - in effect designing our own path toward the goal of love each of us seeks.

This is a true story that illuminates life. In Evelyn's courage you will discover the force of faith, and traces of the invisible design that guides every person's return to love."
