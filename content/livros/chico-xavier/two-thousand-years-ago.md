Emmanuel, the spirit author of this amazing book, describes one of his reincarnations into a place of power, passion and conspiracy. It was the period when he lived as Publius Lentulus – a powerful senator of the Roman Empire – in Palestine during the time of Christ. He tells about his meeting with Jesus and the healing of his daughter. The book focuses on important episodes of the history of Christianity during the 1st. century. There are unforgettable moments, such as the deaths of the first Christian martyrs.
