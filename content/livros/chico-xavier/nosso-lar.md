Nosso Lar, Portuguese for "Our Home," is the name of the spiritual colony that the spirit André Luiz introduces to us in the first book of his acclaimed series, "Life in the Spiritual World." The book, whose full title is "Nosso Lar: an Account of Life in a Spiritual Colony in the World of Spirits," is a compelling narrative wherein the author tells us of his impressions and discoveries about life in the spiritual world as he acts as a sort of journalist, who records his own experiences as they occur.

André Luiz unveils an exciting world, filled with life and activity, and which is organized in an exemplary way. It is a place where discarnate spirits go through a recovery stage and a spiritual educational process supervised by high-order spirits. Nosso Lar enables us to get a glimpse of the spirit world that awaits us after we leave our physical bodies.
