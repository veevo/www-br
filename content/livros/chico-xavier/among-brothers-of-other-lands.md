n 1965, the Brazilian mediums Francisco C. Xavier and Waldo Vieira travelled to several countries, including the United States of America, England and France, in a mission to exchange the Spiritist knowledge and visit friends. The first part of the book contains mediumistic messages received in the Portuguese language. Among them, there are interesting interviews with Brother X and William James, and many other respectable people from other nations. The second part is composed of messages directly received in the English language. This is a book that brings us eloquent teachings on Spiritism and Christ consciousness once it approaches the following topics: reincarnation, mediumship, obsession, and culture. It opens new perspectives for a greater understanding of our brothers and sisters of all lands.
