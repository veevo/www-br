This book by Yvonne A. Pereira is divided into two parts.
In Part One, the spirit Bezerra de Menezes tells “A Sad Story,” which took place in a poverty-stricken community in Rio de Janeiro in the 19th century, and where Palmira, an incarnate spirit, is righting past wrongs by means of trials entailing selflessness and patience.

In Part Two, Camilo Castelo Branco narrates the touching mediumistic novel “The Castle Treasure,” set in Portugal in 1640, in which he shows that love and kindness are indispensable qualities for one’s peace of mind while undergoing moral reform.

Focusing on the law of Cause and Effect, both narratives spread the Spiritist principles, thus comforting and informing those suffering the imposition of harsh trials.
