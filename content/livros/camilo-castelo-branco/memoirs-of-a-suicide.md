Under the guidance of the spirit Leon Denis and using the penname Camilo Candido Botelho, the spiritual author Camilo Castelo Branco describes to the medium Yvonne A. Pereira his dreadful experience after discarnation through suicide. The book entails invaluable instruction, demonstrating the greatness of the Divine Mercy towards repentant suicides as it provides them with the opportunity to understand the universe and life in its fullest dimension. The beginnings of planet Earth, the evolution of the human being, the immortality of the soul, Christian morality, and other relevant themes are presented for the understanding that “… no attempt at moral growth will work if we remain imprisoned in self-ignorance.” A complete reading of this work shows that there is a road of reconstruction for those who repent. Rehabilitation is possible for there is always hope.
