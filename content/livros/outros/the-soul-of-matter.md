## Description
What is the contribution of Spiritism to Medicine?  
Should people be cloned?  
Should human embryos be produced?  
 This book answers these questions and many others, presenting topics such as:  
·       Principles of Spiritist Medicine and Bioethics  
·       Human Cloning  
·       Constitution of the Perispirit   

With them emerges an integral view of the Human Being: Spirit-matter. In pathological cases, it relates biological, social, and psychological factors, but above all, the spiritual ones; in processes of cure, it mobilizes all available resources as well as those which are linked to the soul and its essence: faith, prayer, and love.
