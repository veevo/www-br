## Description
Many themes in “The Spirits’ Book” by Allan Kardec are adequate and understandable to children and teenagers. However, other themes may seem too complex and out of reach, or even uninteresting to such young minds. In “The Little Spirits’ Book,” specific questions and answers were selected from “The Spirits’ Book” that are more in tune with the interest and the universe of children and teenagers. The language was modernized and adapted, making it easier for the young and/or novice public to understand, while staying faithful to everything that Allan Kardec and the spirits meant to transmit.

The main goal of “The Little Spirits’ Book” is to serve as a stimulus so that young and novice readers may fully engage the essence of the wonderful book that is Allan Kardec’s “The Spirits’ Book” later in life or when maturity permits.
