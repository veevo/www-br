## Description
This book proposes a challenge. It questions the traditional thinking about how children come to be. Most of us take for granted that our babies are entirely created by ourselves, mom and dad. Yet parents only offer the baby genetic conditions to construct physical bodies they need to live for however long, in this world of ours. Further, it is widely believed that each baby comes with a brand new soul or spirit created for that specific body. That is not the case however.

Each and every baby comes with a PAST. Are you ready to face this challenge?
