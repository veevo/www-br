## Description
Spiritual body, problems in the great transition, abortion, suicide, euthanasia, cremation, fatal accidents, cemeteries, funerals, premonition, death of children… These and many other topics are discussed in this book. The author describes the circumstances and problems associated with the return to the Spiritual World. The reader will find in these pages an invaluable contribution to overcome age-old fears and anguish that disturb people when dealing with death.

The book offers the reader a good-humored insight on death. Richard Simonetti shows that death is far from being that horrible skeleton with its sinister scythe, tearing our hopes apart; instead, death is rather a door that leads us into the spiritual world, where we have come from, where our true nation lies. In bried chapters, illustrated with cartoons, "Who Is Afraid of Death?" deals with the most important topics concerning the great transition, providing confidence for those who depart and hope and solace for those who stay behind.
