## Description
No one appreciates our undue interventions. However, one of the objectives of this book is of expressing a cry of alert, a call for a conscious analysis regarding our imperfections and our lack of understanding in the face of the moral and educational crisis that prevails in the present day.  We can all benefit from this book, regardless of our age, profession, sex, or religion.  The simplicity and smoothness of its stories pave the way for a life of harmony and happiness.

This great book consists of a collection of 39 short stories, each a simple but clear suggestion about how we can improve our lives through ethical growth. It does not matter which religion, gender or profession you have or how old you are, this book will help you re-examine your views on the principles that you follow and those you do not embrace in your daily life.
