## Description
This book is an exposure of mediumship problems by someone who has lived them, and still does, guided down winding pathways by Kardec’s compass, the only truly valid one, and approved by the Spirit of Truth, who symbolizes spiritual wisdom in communion with human wisdom. Those who do not understand the need for this combination in dealing with spiritual problems are not apt to deal with Spiritism, a doctrine that covers the complete human knowledge, and adds to it the spirital dimensions, which the other initially lacked for grasping reality in its entirety. The world is its object, reason its method, and mediumship its laboratory.
