## Description
The name of Francisco Cândido (“Chico”) Xavier (1910-2002) is already a legend in his native Brazil, yet he remains almost unknown in the English-speaking world. In this book, Guy Lyon Playfair tell the extraordinary story of how a poorly educated man from a very modest background rose to become a national hero while refusing any payment other than the wages he earned as a government employee. He also discusses Chico’s phenomenal literary output of more than 450 books and the countless message he received that provide some of the most compelling evidence yet recorded for survival after death.
