## Description
 Patrícia disincarnated at nineteen years of age.  During her brief stay with us on Earth, she was a spiritist by conviction and an active seeker of eternal truths.  Her disincarnation was like going to sleep and waking up in the spiritual plane among friends. She was fascinated by what she saw, and by the experiences reported to her by her companions, whose adventures she would later pass on to us incarnates.

Violets on the Window describes the experiences of a person conscientous of what disincarnation means.  It removes one more veil from the mystery of the afterlife.  Simply, she tells of the beauty of the  Spiritual Plane, and of the needs of the individual spiritis she encounted, as well as her own needs - needs such as: How would she eat? How would she dress? Would she feel cold or hot? Would she need to use the bathroom? Patrícia clearly describes the colony where she was taken, the learning center, the school, hospitals, houses, etc.

Most importantly, Patrícia talks about the help she received from her spiritist relatives and of the moral support from her father, exemplifying to many how to act when facing the physical death of a loved one.
