## Description
Eternal Bonds of Love is a poignant account of a young man's afterlife experiences after his death at age 20. Ricardo passed after an accidental fall at College on September 18, 2005. He started communicating through written messages to his father in July, 2006. In July, 2007, he communicated to his parents that they would be writing a book together, to be finished and published in one year's time.  And so they did!

You will find, in this unusual book, Ricardo's story about his experiences, feelings, emotions, and spiritual development in the first two years after his untimely and unexpected passing. He shares his stages of evolution, his "new life", changes in his "body and habits", and the "people" he encounters along the way. Through his verses, one is carried away to another reality, where love, compassion, understanding and spiritual growth are the dominant features and goals of those living "after death".

This book is recommended to all those that have "lost" loved ones and find themselves not knowing "what to believe" or how to heal from their never-ending pain. It is especially touching to those that are struggling to live on after a child's unexpected death. It is comforting, hopeful, and inspiring and teaches us that true love has no boundaries, no limits, that time and space are an illusion and that love binds us together eternally wherever we are.
