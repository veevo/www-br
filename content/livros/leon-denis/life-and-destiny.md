## Description
Who are we? Where did we come from? Where are we going? Why do we suffer? This is the formidable puzzle faced by the human being, which Leon Denis reveals with clarity and precision, and with a strong foundation in the principles of the Spiritist Doctrine.

The eminent French writer, disciple of Allan Kardec, presents us with a set of valuable lessons, where logic is united with sentiment, to exalt the reality of the spirit's survival after the phenomenon of death.

This work is divided in three parts and analyzes topics such as: the evolution of thought, life in the beyond, historical proofs of reincarnation, the law of destiny, powers of the soul, and other issues that are current and exciting.

**Note: voted by FEB (Brazilian Spiritist Federation) as one of the 10 best Spiritist books of the 20th century.**
