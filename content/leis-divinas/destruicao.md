All things in the material world, everything from a human body to the worlds in our solar system will eventually end. The elements within them of course will simply change from one form to another. This change is a necessity because from it comes renewal. On a smaller scale on earth there is constant birth, death and rebirth, materially speaking. Fire and natural calamities bring much destruction but eventually it brings about renewal. For intelligent beings like us, destruction is just another tool for learning. As our bodies decay we endure and learn from these changes. For human societies, destruction and rebuilding means grouth and new opportunities for the society to take more positive paths to meet its goals.

Now the forms of destruction caused by war and murder are not seen as part of the law of destruction. Life is sacred, and the intentional taking of a life is always a violation of divine law. And as such has clear and rational consequences in order for those involved to learn from such errors in judgment.

Destruction, functioning  with instinctual preservation, is a natural part of life.  Designed to establish balance and maintain an equilibrium in nature (and ranging from nature's food chain to natural calamities), it allows for renewal and transformation on Earth.  The need for destruction on each planet exists in proportion to the planet's material level.  All forms of destruction beyond the limits of necessity violate God's laws and indicate the predominance of humanity's physical nature over its spiritual one¹.
