Life in the material realm creates the necessity for food, safety, and well-being that are acquired through labor and activities aimed at both self-preservation and intellectual development.  Work, meaning our engagement in activities that make us useful to others, in both the material and spiritual sense, is necessary to bring us out of our spiritual infancy.  The nature of work required depends on the abilities of the individual.  Rest is also a part of this law;  it restores strength to the body and gives freedom to the mind.  The limit of work is the limit of the individual's level of strength.
