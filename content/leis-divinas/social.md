Humans, unlike animals, have needs beyond ordinary physical wants and instincts beyond self-preservation.  God created humans to live in society, where they are destined to evolve through helping and sharing with each other, benefiting from their many different strengths and learning to love one another.  Family ties are the basis for life in society, and the loosening of such ties means a more deep-rooted selfishness and social ills.  A life of isolation with no contribution to society is one in which no progress is made.
