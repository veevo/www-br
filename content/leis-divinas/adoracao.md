Worship, the result of an unborn feeling or innate instinct, is the act of raising one's thoughts toward God.  True worship, that which is meaningful to God, is that which comes from the heart, and from sincerity and a genuine desire to do what is good and avoid what harmful.  Prayer, an act of worship, serves to draw us closer to God, to give us strength, and to attract good spirits that can help us and others for whom we pray.  The practice of human sacrifice, an ancient custom based on a false idea of what would be acceptable to God, in reality, is contrary to natural law, for God can never be honored by useless destruction.

From the moment our spirit is created, even before our first earthly incarnation, we all instinctively possess an understanding of the existence of God. We innately realize God exists, that this is our creator and that we possess the tool to communicate with this creator, the tool of prayer. This is the actual cause for divine worship found in all human cultures no matter how diverse and isolated.
