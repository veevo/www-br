Simply put, for all beings to continue to exist and evolve in the material world reproduction in some form is a necessity. As for humans, reproduction is a necessity in order for spirits to continue to have opportunities for incarnation and reincarnation. 

The force that leads living beings to seek out one another and reproduce is a natural instinct, without which the world would end.  God permits nothing useless to happen.  Nature has its own resources for the control of excessive population, though the harmony in these resources may not always be apparent in our limited perspective.  All human races will come and go, continuously mixing to produce new types appropriate to the evolutionary stage of the spirits who populate them.  Sex is a divine invention as a means of reproduction, and it should not be confused with an act of sin; however, the abuse of sexuality is a transgression of the divine laws of equilibrium and has its consequences just like any other abuse.
