Personal freedom is a natural right, but absolute freedom in our actions can not exist for we all need each other and two or more people together always have reciprocal rights and duties to respect. The absolute subjection of one human being to another (slavery in whatever form) is contrary to natural law and will disappear with progress.  Also, the more developed one's reason, the more responsible one is for such treatment of another.  Abuse of position, skills, power, etc. by individuals, groups, and nations is never justified before God's law.  It is only in thought that we can enjoy absolute liberty, which may be temporarily hindered but never annihilated.  Even so, we area always responsible to God for our thoughts, which carry their natural consequences. Freedom of conscience, a characteristic of true civilization and progress, arises naturally from freedom of thought, and only God has the right to intervene in matters of conscience. To offend others whose beliefs are different shows a lack of compassion and is an infringement on others' freedom of thought.  Gentleness and compassion, never force, should be used to convince.

Freedom of action, or free will, develops with our freedom of thought and conscience.  It can be exercised according to our spiritual evolution and present physical stage as humans. In humans, it also suffers the influence of matter, including the particular conditions of a given body, as well as some limits created by social status.  We are, however held responsible for exhibiting the efforts to overcome such influences. Voluntary deprivation of reason, i.e. drunkenness and other self-induced conditions, are contrary to natural law.

There is no real "fate", as the term is commonly understood, with the exception of the time of birth, death, and specific life events, including trials, both physical and ethical.  These events may be chosen by a spirit, before a given incarnation, or they may be chosen for him if his developmental states so requires.  In ethical trials, a spirit always preserves its freedom to chose between good and bad. At times, if it is compatible with our life path, we can, through the strong merit of our will and actions, prevent certain foreordained events from happening.  Most often, the future is hidden from our knowledge in order to allow for our freedom and ability to act in the present with initiative, and to make our own choices.  Rarely, however, it may be revealed in order to expedite a particular end by influencing someone to act differently.
