Human Beings are given the free will to act, but they must answer for the consequences of their actions.

Progress is vital to the evolution of a society. Which means that the scientific discoveries that change our society daily, are actually a vital part of God’s plan for all of us. Of course the ethical evolution of a society is also a critical part of this progress. So when scientific discoveries are applied in a society void of solid ethical principles, these tools become instruments of harm instead of the instruments of learning they were intended to be used for.

As for the individual the Law of Progress means that a person is always learning and evolving. A person can get caught up in obsessions and destructive behavior but they can never forget those lessons that have truly been learned or loose the evolution gained from such learning. 

The progress of humanity, which is constant and never reverses, follows a master plan, whereby humans and societies must evolve, both intellectually and morally.  It is a living force; human actions and laws may block it temporarily, but will always be eventually overthrown.  As humanity evolves, human law will also evolve to become more equitable and aligned with natural laws.  When a people fails to progress at a reasonable pace, a major shock, either physical or ethical, may befall them as a way of speeding their transformation, in accordance with the design of Providence.  Intellectual progress helps lead to ethical progress by making people more discerning and better at making choices.  The two great obstacles to ethical progress are pride and selfishness¹.
