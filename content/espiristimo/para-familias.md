The family is at the center together, participating in an activity that will
help them to be conscious of the way they treat one another at home, the way
they interpret the situations and challenges they must face together, and the
way they relate to others outside their home. 

## Fluidic Therapy
In the end (and during) the studies, everyone (including children), is invited
to also participate in the fluidic therapy.
