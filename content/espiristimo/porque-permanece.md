## Why has Spiritism Endured?

Today Spiritism has found a huge rebirth in the UK, Brazil, and America, with growing branches all over Europe and South America.

Since Rivail’s amazing work over 100 years ago countless books on every aspect of Spiritism and its relation to our daily lives have been dictated through mediums from Spirit Teachers. Yet none of these wonderful writings can ever come close to Rivail’s 5 book codification. Even though he was not a medium, he never saw a Spirit, and these works were put to paper over a century ago, these 5 books continue to be the basis of Spiritism. Why?

A simplistic reply would be that these books remain current because the Spirit Teachers intended them to remain current centuries after they were revealed to Rivail. But why did they choose Rivail? What did the Spirit Teachers know about him that made him the correct person to organise and publish the vast amount of information they wanted to share? The answer is two fold:

1- As a child he showed an aptitude for the sciences and philosophy and, at the age of ten, he was sent to the Pestalozzi Institute in Yverdun. This was the school of the influential Swiss educationalist Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, whose radically new methods of teaching were attracting pupils from well connected families all over Europe.

Rivail quickly proved himself to be a child genius of rare distinction. He was asked to teach his own classmates. He also became one of Pestallozi’s favourite pupils and most ardent disciples and left Yverdun with a degree in letters and science and a doctorate in medicine.

Rivail’s most significant achievement was to develop a systematic method of scrutinising mediumistic communications of a philosophical nature that resulted in a consistent body of teachings to suit all needs

His training as a scientist, and acute, rational mind allowed him to detach himself emotionaly and develop a way to verify that what was being communicated from the Spirit Teachers (through many mediums) was exactly what the Spirit Teachers were trying to communicate. This precession assured that the ideas expressed within the codification are consistent, clearly expressed and not influenced by the mediums or by Rivail himself.

2- Rivail came to believe that education was ‘the key to harmonizing the relations between rich and poor’. These factors must have played a major role in making the spirit teachings that Rivail would encounter later in his life appear so attractive to him. Not only would he be open minded enough not to reject them for religious reasons, but they would also appear to be confirmation of his egalitarian beliefs which ran counter to many of the Church’s dogmas.

After leaving the Pestalozzi Institute Rivail settled in Paris and in 1824 he published his first book. This was based on his own system for teaching mathematics and was reprinted until 1876. The following year, at the age of 21, he opened his own ‘First Grade School’ and in 1826 he opened another, ‘The Rivail Technical Institute’. He taught chemistry, physics, mathematics, astronomy, comparative anatomy and rhetoric, and also spoke nine languages…Italian and Spanish fluently. Rivail also submitted proposals for educational reform to the French Legislative Chamber which were highly praised although not adopted.

By 1848, Rivail was a well known and highly respected educator who could have existed quite comfortably for the rest of his life by living on the proceeds of his books

It is obvious that the Spirit Teachers also saw in Rivail a person who was already an established publisher of books on education, and adept at expressing complex ideas in ways that anyone could understand.

In conclusion Rivail’s scientific mind allowed him to accurately filter through the mass amount of communications he sought out, while his ability to publish these ideas in a way that made them easy to understand made him the perfect candidate in the eyes of the Spirit Teachers. That these 5 books are still current today, and still the basis for Spiritism is testament to the genius that was Rivail: the scientist, the educator and publisher of school textbooks.
