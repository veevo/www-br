On this post let's learn the origins of Spiritism.

### The Turning Tables
By 1848, when the [mediumship](../mediumship) of the [Fox
Sisters](/bio/fox-sisters) was creating such a stir in America, Rivail (later
known as [Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec)) was already a well known and highly
respected educator in the French society.

In 1854, Mr Fortier, a friend with a shared interest in the phenomena of
mesmerism told Rivail of the [table-turning](/about/turning-tables) craze that
had, by that time, reached France.  Rivail’s response was typical of the initial
reaction of many other successful 19th century academics who would later risk
their reputations by publicly endorsing [mediumship](../mediumship).  He
replied:

> I will believe it when I see it and when it has been proved to me that a table
> has a brain to think 
and nerves to feel and that it can become a sleep-walker.  Until then, allow me
to see nothing in this but a fable told to provoke sleep.

He would later recall that Fortier told him how 

> …not only is a table made to tilt, magnetising it, but it can also be made to
> speak. 
Ask it a question, and it replies.

Like many others in America and England, Rivail assumed that
[table-turning](/about/turning-tables) was a _purely material effect_ and it was
not until the following year that he allowed himself to be persuaded to attend a
table-turning session in the home of one of Fortier’s mesmeric subjects, a Mrs
Roger. 

It was there that he first witnessed the phenomenon of tables which ‘jumped and
ran under conditions that precluded doubt’ and some ‘very imperfect attempts at
mediumistic writing on a slate’.  But this did no more than arouse Rivail’s
natural curiosity and cause him to make a mental note to investigate the matter
further.

He wrote:

> My ideas were far from being modified, but I saw in those phenomena an effect
> that must have had a cause.
I glimpsed beneath the apparent frivolities and entertainment associated with
these phenomena something serious, perhaps the revelation of a new law, which I
promised myself I would explore.

### The first seances
Rivail was then introduced to a Mr Baudin who held weekly seances at his home.
Baudin’s two daughters (who, by all accounts, were rather frivolous and
empty-headed) were in the habit of obtaining communications by use of
table-tipping.16 Normally the results of their experiments were ample
confirmation of the golden rule ‘like attracts like’, but whenever Rivail was
present, the nature of the communications changed completely.  The usual stream
of banalities was replaced by philosophy of a ‘very grave and serious character’
and Rivail adopted the regular practice of arriving at every meeting armed with
a list of penetrating questions for the new communicators.

Although English accounts of events during this period vary greatly, it is
apparent that, at some point, the planchette medium Celina Japhet also became
involved in providing answers to his questions.

These sessions provided the basis of Spiritist theory by use of table-tipping,
raps and planchette writing.  However, when a group of other investigators who
had collected over 50 notebooks full of communications asked Rivail to arrange
them into some sort of order he initially refused.

Whether or not this was because he was not yet sufficiently enthused about the
subject to absorb himself in such an arduous task is any body’s guess, but he
eventually changed his mind.

### Invisible Intelligences
After two years of scrutinising the communications he remarked to his wife:

> My conversations with the invisible intelligences have completely
> revolutionised my ideas and convictions.
The instructions thus transmitted constitute an entirely new theory of human
life, duty, and destiny, that appears to me to be perfectly rational and
coherent, admirably lucid and consoling, and intensely interesting.  I have a
great mind to publish these conversations in a book; for it seems to me that
what interests me so deeply might very likely prove interesting to others.

When Rivail submitted this idea to the communicators they replied:

> To the book…you will give, as being our work rather than yours, the title of
> Le Livre des Espirits (The Spirits’ Book);
and you will publish it, not under your own name, but under the pseudonym of
Allan Kardec [‘Kardec’ was an old Breton name in his mother’s family].  Keep
your own name of Rivail for your own books already published.’ 

Rivail then took on the task of editing the fifty notebooks, classifying the
different types of communication according to their character and the inner
consistency of their arguments.

To these he added further communications from Japhet and then, still not being
satisfied that the material was sufficiently verified, submitted his questions
to a number of other mediums. 

### The Mediumistic Phenomena
Throughout, he used what he called the principle of ‘concordance’ or
‘conformity’ by which he meant that he accepted as most likely to be true, the
answers that could not only ‘resolve all the difficulties of the question’, but
were also consistent with answers from other, independent, sources.

He would write many years later of his early attempts to explain [mediumistic
phenomena](../mediumship) and make sense of contradictory statements about
spirit life by spirits:

> ‘I tried to identify the causes of the phenomena by linking the facts
> logically, 
and I did not accept an explanation as valid unless it could resolve all the
difficulties of the question.  This was the way I had always, from the age of
fifteen or sixteen, proceeded in my investigations… One of my first observations
was that the Spirits, being only the souls of men, did not have either absolute
wisdom or absolute knowledge; their knowledge was limited to the level of their
advancement and their opinion had only the value of a personal opinion.
Recognising this fact, from the beginning saved me from the serious error of
believing in the Spirits’ infallibility and prevented me from formulating
premature theories based upon the opinion of only one or a few Spirits.’
