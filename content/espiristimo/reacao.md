## Introduction
Even though the [Spiritist Codification](/spirism/codification) made
[Rivail](/about/allan-kardec) a house hold name in much of the continent, the UK
and later in America and Brazil, for him personally putting the revelations of
the [Spirit Teachers](/about/superior-spirits) to paper cost him dearly.

The Spirit teachers had told Rivail that he would find harsh criticism and
resistance among the Church, among other intellectuals and even among the
growing Spiritist organizations that were forming as a result of the
[Codification](/spiritism/codification).

Even physically Rivail would pay a hard price for taking on this immense task.
Unfortunately that was exactly how things progressed.

## Before the publication of The Spirits' Book
Before the publication of The Spirits’ Book in 1856, the Holy Office, under
[Pope Pius IX](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_IX), had prohibited mediumship
and ‘other analogous superstitions’ as ‘heretical, scandalous, and contrary to
the honesty of customs’.

But in 1861 the Bishop of Barcelona took more direct action.  He ordered an
auto-da-fe (act of the faith) known as the [Edict of
Barcelona](//www.researchgate.net/publication/291873151_The_celebrated_burning_in_Barcelona_on_October_9_1861_A_history_revisited),
against three-hundred Spiritist books, including many by Rivail, that were
confiscated and burnt in public.

However, the Bishop’s actions did nothing more than stir up French nationalism
and contribute to the further growth of Spiritism in both France and Spain.

Hess adds that when the Bishop died nine months afterwards, his repentant spirit
manifested through several French [mediums](/about/medium) begging for Rivail’s
forgiveness which was, apparently, granted.

In France, the dean of the Faculty of Theology of Lyons began public education
courses against Spiritism and Mesmerism in 1864 and Spiritism was widely branded
as a form of demon worship in writings by clergymen.

## Spiritism vs the Catholic Church
Rivail accused the Church of deliberately inciting hatred against Spiritists:

> From the pulpit, we Spiritists have been called enemies of society and public
> order…In some places, Spiritists were censured to the point of being
> persecuted and injured on the streets, while the faithful were forbidden to
> hire Spiritists and were warned to avoid them as they would avoid the plague.  

> Women were advised to separate from their husbands. Charity has been refused
> to the needy and workers have lost their livelihoods, just because they were
> Spiritists.  

> Blind men have even been discharged, against their will, from some hospitals
> because they would not renounce their beliefs.  


## Spiritism, Spiritualism and America
As with Spiritualism in America and Britain, certain sections of the French
scientific establishment also reacted with hostility to the spread of Spiritism.

Hess mentions that a Dr Dechambre, a member of the Academy of Medicine,
published a critique of the movement in 1859, and also cites reports of
insanity, allegedly caused by Spiritism, that had started to circulate by 1863.

There was even a French equivalent to the theory, which originated in America,
that spirit raps were produced by the cracking of the knee and toe joints.

The French variation on this theme was presented to the Academy of Medicine by a
surgeon, M. Jobert, who attributed the noises to skilful cracking of the short
tendon of the muscle of the instep.

## In defense of Spiritism
Kardec spent the remainder of his life defending Spiritism from attacks from
every direction.

In spite of having developed a heart condition, Rivail never stopped his
tireless works in the study, teaching and spreading of Spiritism.

Inevitably in March 31st, 1869 he succumb to an aneurysm, dieing instantly in
the small Spiritist bookstore he ran out of his home.
