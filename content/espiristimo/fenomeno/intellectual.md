## Intellectual Phenomena

### Intro
The nature of the communication that exists between the medium and the spirit can be placed in two main categories: Physical and Intellectual Phenomena.

The first refers to all mediumship phenomena that involves the spirit acting upon inanimate objects in the physical world by using energy from the medium.

The second refers to all phenomena in which information is the product of the communication.

This article discusses Physical Phenomena. For more information on Intellectual Phenomena, please click here.

### Intelligent Phenomena
How mediumship of Intelligent Phenomena works:

In Physical Phenomena the spirit trying to communicate takes magnetized animalistic fluid from the medium to use in the magnetization of objects; in the case of Intelligent Phenomena there is no such taking. In this second kind of phenomena the spirit communicating and the medium come to an agreement through the Law Of Affinity. As stated earlier in this law intelligent beings share an affinity or repulsion based on the mperfections and virtues they share in common.

When the Spirit comes near, the medium receives vibrations from the spirit; if there is an affinity, a bond between the perispirits of both the Spirit and the medium occurs. A conversation, in every sense of the word then takes place between these two beings in two different dimensions.

The level of awareness of the medium before, during and after this kind of communication takes place is determined by the kind of mediumship, the level of development of the mediumship and the nature of the agreement made between the two participants. Many times these agreements first occur between the spirit and the medium before the medium reincarnates. But this is not always the case.

Another important point to note is that no matter the type of intelligent communication phenomena, the medium is not a direct mouth piece for the spirit, instead the medium is an interpreter for the Spirit. Which means the medium expresses what is being communicated from the spirit, based in his/her own level of understanding the message being filtered through his/her own brain. This is why more evolved Spirits tend to seek out more ethically/intellectually evolved mediums so that what the medium understands is most closely exact to what the Spirit is communicating.
