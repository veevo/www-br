## Physical Phenomena

The nature of the communication that exists between the medium and the spirit can be placed in two main categories: Physical and Intellectual Phenomena.

The first refers to all mediumship phenomena that involves the spirit acting upon inanimate objects in the physical world by using energy from the medium.

The second refers to all phenomena in which information is the product of the communication.

This article discusses Physical Phenomena. For more information on Intellectual Phenomena, please click here.

### Physical Phenomena
Let's learn how mediumship of Physical Phenomena works.

On the “Mediums’ Book”, questions 75 and 76, Kardec writes:
>“The universal fluid, in which resides the principle of life, is the chief agent of Spirit-manifestation, and this agent receives its impulse from the Spirit, whether the latter be incarnate or discarnate. This fluid, condensed, constitutes the perispirit or, in other words, the semi-material envelope of the Spirit. In the state of incarnation, the perispirit is united to the matter of the body; in the erratic state, it is free. When the Spirit is incarnated, the substance of the perispirit is more or less bound, more or less adherent, if we may be allowed the expression. With certain persons, a sort of emanation of this fluid takes place, as the result of their organization, and it is this fact, strictly speaking, which explains the peculiar qualities of physical mediums. The emission of this animalized fluid may be more or less abundant, its combination more or less easy and mediums will accordingly be more or less powerful. There is nothing to guarantee the permanence of the medianimic faculty and the occasional loss of power by mediums is thus explained.

Let us here call in the aid of comparison. When we desire to act physically upon a given point at a distance, it is our thought which determines the action, but thought cannot of itself strike the blow; it must have an intermediary which it directs, such as a stick, a projectile, a current of air, etc. Observe, too , that thought does not act directly upon the stick, for if the stick is not touched, it will not act. The source of thought, which is nothing else than the Spirit incarnated within us, is united to the body by the perispirit. However, the thought can no more act upon the body without the perispirit, than it can act upon the stick without the body. Thought acts upon the perispirit because the perispirit acts upon the muscles, the muscles seize the stick, and the stick strikes the mark. When the Spirit is not incarnated, he/she requires an extraneous auxiliary; this auxiliary is the vital fluid, by the aid of which he renders the object apt to obey the impulsion of his will.

When an object is set in motion, carried away, or raised into the air, the Spirit does not seize it, push it, or lift it, as we do with our hands; the Spirit, so to say, saturates it with his/her own fluid combined with that of the medium, and the object, being thus vivified for the moment, acts as a living being would act, with this difference, that not having a will of its own, it follows the impulsion communicated to it by the will of the Spirit.”

For this kind of phenomena to occur the medium must possess the ability to instinctively project from its perispirit an animalistic fluid called ectoplasm. Once in a trance state the ectoplasm passes through the mediums pours, or through the eyes, mouth and ears. The spirit wanting to make the phenomena happen will use this ectoplasm from the medium, from the people (non-mediums) in the immediate environment where the effect will take place, and directly from nature. Once the spirit has taken ectoplasm from these 3 sources it can manipulate (using its perispirit) this semi transparent substance and use it to act upon physical objects, or create effects perceivable by non-mediums with their 5 senses.

The ectoplasm taken from people in the environment does not require these people to be in a trance state or even aware that this is happening. While ectoplasm from mediums appears white and a solid cloud like, for the people not in a trance the ectoplasm appears as sweat coming from their pours.

Physical phenomena is generally associated with the communication with spirits of lower orders, first because its teaching value for those who witness the phenomena is extremely limited and second because the phenomena requires a spirit that has a very materialized perispirit, not a characteristic of more evolved spirits. Also, the fact that spirit communications through physical phenomena has such a destructive toll on the medium is evidence of the involvement of spirits of lower orders.

One important point also to consider is that many times Spirits of different orders work in groups for a phenomena to take place, so the spirits of lower order may be the ones instigating the phenomena, but spirits of higher orders may be the ones giving instruction for it to occur.



### TYPES OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA

The classification bellow is taken from The Mediums’ Book chapter 14, items 173-189

#### Rapping Mediums
Those by whose influence noises and raps are produced. A very common variety of medianimity, whether voluntary or involuntary.

#### Motor Mediums
Those who produce the movement of inert bodies. These are also very common.

#### Mediums For Displacements and Suspensions
Those who obtain the displacement of inert bodies, and their suspension in the air without any visible prop. There are some who are thus raised themselves, but these are very rare.

Mediums For Musical Effects: These obtain the playing of certain instruments without human contact.

Mediums for Apparitions: Those who obtain apparitions, whether fluidic or tangible, which are visible to onlookers. Very exceptionally rare. (see Ch XVI, starting at item 104)

Mediums For the Transport of Objects: Those who are employed by Spirits as auxiliaries in bringing objects to a circle. Exceptionally rare. (see Ch XVI, item 96)

Nocturnal Mediums: Those who only obtain certain physical effects in the dark.

Here is the answer of a Spirit to our inquiry as to whether such mediums should be considered as forming a separate variety: “This form of medianimity may certainly be spoken of as a specialty, although the necessity of darkness has to do rather with surrounding conditions than with the nature of the medium, or with that of the manifesting Spirits; for, in fact, some of these mediums get over this peculiar necessity, and the greater number of those who are mediums only in the dark could, by exercise, obtain the same manifestations in the light. There are but few of this variety of mediums; and we feel bound to point out that this peculiar form of medianimity offers a wide field for trickery, ventriloquism, acoustic tubes, etc, enabling charlatans to play upon credulity and to pocket money…But [the charlatans] will be unmasked in the long run, and Spirits will show them that it is not prudent for pretenders to intermeddle with their work.” “Erastes”

Pneumatographic Mediums: Those who obtain direct writing. This is a very rare phenomenon, and one easily imitated. (see Ch XVI, item 177)
Our Spirit-guides have insisted, contrary to our opinion, in placing direct writing in the order of physical phenomena, because, according to them, “Intelligent effects are those for the production of which the spirit makes use of the medium’s brain, which is not done in the production of direct writing; the action of the medium, in this case, being altogether physical, while, in the case of the writing-medium, though the action may be merely mechanical, the medium’s brain always takes an active part in it.”

Healing Mediums: Those who have the power of curing disease or relieving pain, by the imposition of hands or by prayer. Spirits’ Comments: “This faculty is not essentially medianimic; it appertains to all true believers, whether mediums or not; it is often only a super-excitement of the mesmeric power, strengthened, in case of need, by the co-operation of benevolent Spirits.”

Developing Mediums: Persons who, by their influence, have the power of developing the faculties of mediumship in others. Spirits’ Comments: “This is rather an effect of animal magnetism than a fact of medianimity properly so called, for there is in it nothing that proves the intervention of a Spirit. At all events it may be classified under the head of physical effects.”

One can directly infer from the above list that all the phenomena associated with haunting, poltergeists, ghost apparitions and other similar phenomena are the result of a Spirit using ectoplasm from a medium of physical phenomena in the general vicinity of the phenomena.

It is important to note that even though the creating of ectoplasm by a medium can be dangerous and draining for the medium, giving of ectoplasm in small quantities can occur without the medium ever being aware that this is occurring. Also ectoplasm in a more diluted form can remain in a confined environment like a building for long periods of time after it has been used by a Spirit.
