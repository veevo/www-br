Spiritism can and should be [studied](../how-to-study), analyzed and put into
practice in all fundamental aspects of life, such as: [science](../science),
[philosophy](../philosophy), [religion](../religion), [ethics](/about/ethics),
[morality](/about/moral), [virtues](/virtues), education and social life.

All practical activities that happen on [Spiritist Centers](../centers) such as
[mediumship](../mediumship), [fraternal
assistance](../centers/fraternal-assistance) are free of any charge, which
follows the [Gospel](/gospel) principle that we must _"give for free what we
receive for free."_

Spiritist institurions don't charge for any of the work that one is expected to
be there.

## Practicing Spiritism
Spiritism is practiced without rites or rituals, adhering to the Christian
principle that [God](/about/god) should be adored in spirit and truth.

There is no ministry within Spiritism, neither does it adopt or use in its
meetings or in its practices any of the following: vestments, alcoholic
beverages, incense, tobacco, altars, banners, candles, processions, talismans,
amulets, sacraments, the making of promises and the paying of penances,
horoscopes, fortune telling with cards or sea shells, pyramids, crystals, or any
other form of cultism.

Spiritism does not impose its principles. It invites all those who are
interested in exploring its teachings to submit them to the test of reason
before accepting them.


## Spiritist Centers
The place where Spiritists gather are referred to as [Spiritist
Centers](Spiritist Center).  There, spiritists collaborate with one another and
with the [spiritual guides](/about/spiritual-guide) of the house performing
activities such as studying, practicing, praying and promoting Spiritism.

## Mediumship
[Mediumship](../mediumship), is the name of the faculty which facilitates the
communication between [spirits](/about/spirit) and man. It is a gift anyone can
have, regardless of the belief system they may choose to follow. 

Spiritist mediumship is only that which is practiced based upon the principles
of Spiritism and within [Christian morality](/gospel). The practice of
mediumship without the [moral](/about/moral) is dangerous and should be in all
cases avoided.
