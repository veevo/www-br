##  How to Practice SPIRITISM

»  Spiritism can and should be studied, analyzed and put into practice in all fundamental aspects of life, such as: science, philosophy, religion, ethics, morality, education and social life.

»  All practical Spiritism (mediumship, dissemination, fraternal assistance)  is free of any charge, which follows the Gospel principle that we must "give for free what we receive for free."

»  Spiritism is practiced without rites or rituals, adhering to the Christian principle that God should be adored in spirit and truth.

»  There is no ministry within Spiritism,  neither does it adopt or use in its meetings or in its practices any of the following: vestments, alcoholic beverages, incense, tobacco, altars, banners, candles, processions, talismans, amulets, sacraments, the making of promises and the paying of penances, horoscopes, fortune telling with cards or sea shells, pyramids, crystals, or any other form of cultism.

»  Spiritism does not impose its principles. It invites all those who are interested in exploring its teachings to submit them to the test of reason before accepting them.

»  Mediumship, which permits the communication of the spirits with man, is a gift anyone can have, regardless of the belief system they may choose to follow. 

»  Spiritist mediumship is only that which is practiced based upon the principles of Spiritism and within Christian morality.

»  Spiritism respects all religions, values all efforts towards the practice of goodness and recognizes that "a true person of goodness is one who fulfils the laws of justice, love and charity in their purest forms."
