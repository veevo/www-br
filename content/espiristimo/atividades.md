You may wonder where those who follow Spiritism go to meet, study, work, and
pray together.

Spiritists do not have what is commonly referred to as a church, temple, shrine,
etc. That's because Spiritism is not a religion in the traditional sense, there
exists no hierarchical structure of authority or dogmatic practices. 

Spiritists gather in Spiritist Centers. There, they collaborate, with one
another and with the [spiritual guides](/about/spiritual-guide), in the study,
practice, promote and divulge Spiritism. 

## Organization
Spiritist Centers operate independently, though some are affiliated with larger
associations or federations that bring various Centers together for events and
special initiatives related to the dissemination of Spiritism.  The Centers are
often (though not always) named after a historical pioneer of Spiritism, a
mentoring Spirit, or sometimes a charitable quality, etc. Ì¶  for example, Allan
Kardec Spiritist Center, Andre Luiz Spiritist Center, Love and Fraternity
Spiritist Center, etc.

## Structure
Centers are often run by a board of directors, but these are elected positions.
Such positions, as well as those involving the other work that goes on in
managing the Center and organizing and running its activities are non-paid
positions. The people who work in a Spiritist center and fulfill those roles do
so as volunteers.

So what goes on at the Spiritist Center?

## Typical Activities at a Spiritist Center
A Spiritist center is more than just a place to study. It is a place to pray,
learn, grow, collaborate, and work for the  benefit of others.  It is often said
that a Spiritist center is a home, a school, and a hospital, all in one.

Spiritist centers cover an extremely broad spectrum in terms of size, number,
and scope of activities.  There are some centers with as few as 10 or 20 people,
others with hundreds, and even, in some cases, thousands of members.  Still,
there are some basic activities common to most centers, regardless of size.

## Free of Charge
All practical activities that happen on [Spiritist Centers](../centers) such as
[mediumship](../mediumship), dissemination, [fraternal
assistance](../centers/fraternal-assistance) are free of any charge, which
follows the [Gospel](/gospel) principle that we must "give for free what we
receive for free.".  

Spiritist institurions don't charge for any of the work that one is expected to
be there.
