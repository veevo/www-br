[Spiritism](/spiritism) is not actually a separate, distinct religion. There are
no churches, no dogmas, mysteries, rituals, or initiations, and there exists no
priestly or ministerial hierarchy.

At the same time, the spirits who brought us the teachings of Spiritism did not
come to destroy any religion or make Spiritism the only one. Their objective was
to reveal the undiscovered (or forgotten) [laws of nature](/divine-laws) and to
prove, by demonstration, what other religions teach only in theory:
[soul](/about/soul), [the afterlife](/about/), compensation for [Earthly
miseries of this world](/spiritism/science), etc. 

## Religare
_Religion_ in its essence, is a word the derives from latin `Religare` which is
the combination of words `Re` and `Legare` meaning re-connect. It is supposed to
denote that reconnection or direct connection that all of us have with our
eternal father, [God](/about/god), implicit within us.

Spiritism is the the doctrine of the Spirits. It teaches us how to use implicit
connection that thrives from the heart and reaches [God](/about/god) directly,
without a need for any intermediary, place or time.

## The Promised Consoler
Most people don't know that Spiritism is the [Consoler promised by Jesus on the
Bible](/gospel) which was originally menthored by [The Spirit of
Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth), Jesus himself.

It is a true and profound lesson of regenaration of the soul via reflexive
studies that anyone can do

It is a call to excercise with the heart the
essential virtues of [humility](/virtues/humility), [love](/virtues/love) and
[charity](/virtues/charity).

### The Codifier
[Allan Kardec](/profiles/allan-kardec) worked a lot for the purity of the
[doctrine](/spiritism)

It's important to note that the doctrine was born out
of his intensive and persistent work after years of observation, scrutinization
and confirmation



It's also important to state that the doctrine was neither written by Kardec
(although he writes many sections and comments within it) neither it was
dictated empirically. It is the result of a profound collaboration between the
mediums, Kardec, the [superior spirits](/about/superior-spirit) and [The Spirit
of Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth), Jesus himself.

## A rational faith
You may be thinking by now that the above arguments made thus not really new,
and thus wondering, what, if anything, Spiritism can add to all of this?  Well,
very similar to the idea of an intelligent cause having an intelligent effect is
the statement made by the philosopher, Descartes, when he said that “the more we
conceive of perfection in something, the more we should believe that its cause
is even more perfect.”  Spiritism gives us a better idea about the perfection in
the cause of all things by helping us to understand what we don’t immediately
conceive of, or perceive with our five material senses

Spiritism does not
offer merely a sound, theoretical argument as to the existence of spirits.
Through physical demonstration and in the results of the direct observation of
spiritual phenomena (all carefully studied, analyzed and cross-examined), we are
given undeniable proof as to the existence and survival of the soul beyond the
death of the physical body

Proof of the soul’s existence and survival is
further evidence of an intelligent cause or creator

Not only that, but through
the revelations or explanations of  superior spirits regarding the existence of
reincarnation, and through the experiences shared by spirits of varying degrees
who come to tell us about life in the spiritual realms and the conditions
(positive and negative) they find themselves in as a result of their actions on
Earth,  we are better able to understand God’s perfection, as well as his
justice and love for all of his children.

In the end, the qualities that help lead us to a belief in the existence of God
are humility, reasoning, and a clean heart

Humility opens our eyes to the
perfection and beauty of nature, as well as the recognition of an intelligent
cause outside of matter and above all that exists

The teachings of Spiritism
aid in the exercise of reasoning that helps us to understand God, not as a ruler
inspired by passions typical of our inferior humanity (such as vengeance or
selfishness), but as a God who is all-powerful, just, and good

Spiritist
reasoning also teaches us that we can have an intimate relationship with God,
without the intervention of other so-called “appointed” persons

Lastly, Jesus
said, “Blessed are those with clean hearts, for they will see God.” In other
words, we can rationalize or deduce by intuition the existence of God, but we
will never truly know him until we free ourselves from our ties to material
things, from our vices and negative passions, thereby not only cleaning, but
opening our hearts to God and his truths.

## Beyond Religion?
The revelations introduced by Spiritism, as well as the proofs it provided, lead
those in doubt to understand the true nature of [God's laws](/divine-laws) with
a rational faith. [Spiritism’s teachings](../teachings), thereby, instill in
these individuals the will to self-reform (both personal and societal). Rather
than being exclusively a religion, Spiritism is also a
[philosophy](../philosophy) with moral consequences.

In the book, Basic Spiritism, Barbosa writes that the fundamentals of Spiritist
philosophy are based on:
> "[the existence of God](/articles/does-god-exist), as the supreme intelligence
> and cause of all things; [evolution](/divine-laws/evolution) as the general
> law to which everything is subordinate except for God himself;
> [reincarnation](../reincarnation) as the predominant factor in divine justice;
> and the exercise and results of the use of our [free
> will](/divine-laws/free-will)."

As [Kardec](/about/allan-kardec) said then,
> "We can consider the Doctrine of Spiritism in its religious aspect when it
> establishes a moral tie between men, leading them in the direction of the
> creator, through the application of the moral teachings of Christ." (Kardec,
> 1866;  2000) <br><br>	     	The moral consequences of the Spiritist
> philosophy arise when we consider our responsibilities as spiritual beings on
> a path of moral and intellectual evolution. We start out on our journey of
> evolution, ignorant and simple-minded, on a mission to reach a state of
> purification in which we have a complete knowledge of divine laws and a
> pureness of heart that commands our behavior. This purity, however, can only
> be achieved through great efforts toward personal growth, exercised over a
> series of numerous incarnations

Through this, we eventually learn to
> demonstrate, consistently, all the moral qualities that are characteristic of
> pure spirits— qualities such as compassion, forgiveness, honesty,
> selflessness, humility, resignation, etc. (Kardec, 1985)




##  Without Charity, There is No Salvation
Spiritism teaches that without charity, there is no salvation, making it
necessary, as Barbosa states, "for man to have faith and for his actions to be
in agreement with God's laws of fraternity, benevolence, altruism, humility,
work, tolerance, and solidarity, in harmony with others, and even with the
inferior beings of creation." 

Becoming more charitable, acting consistently out of a love that does not
discriminate, will save us from our suffering by helping us to stop causing more
suffering, to start redeeming ourselves of our past mistakes, and to fill our
hearts with the happiness that comes from a love both given and received.

The seeds of enlightenment and the answers to finding true peace and happiness
of the spirit have been disseminated by many influential or exemplary figures
throughout history. The enlightened spirits have stated, as recorded by Kardec
in the "Spirits' Book"¹, that Jesus is the "greatest model of charity and moral
perfection that we have to follow," and you will find that the moral lessons
highlighted in Spiritism focus on Jesus' teachings.

Spiritism does not teach us, however, that we are "forgiven for our sins"
because of Jesus’ death on the cross

When we make mistakes, we are not
actually "forgiven", because God does not condemn us in the first place.
Instead, according to the natural law of cause and effect, we experience the
negative repercussions of our errors. Then, sooner or later, in this incarnation
or beyond, we come to understand the poor choice or choices that we made.
Instinctually, we desire to make amends, and God, in his infinite mercy, gives
us endless chances to do so, through the process of reincarnation

Not only
that, but He gives us access to various forms of guidance, including the
communication with our spirit friends and mentors, by way of our own intuition,
as well as the moral instruction from more advanced beings who incarnate on
Earth with the role of collaborating in the progress of mankind.

Jesus came, as Kardec said,
> "to teach humanity that true life is not the one lived here on Earth but in
> the Kingdom of heaven, to show us the pathway to this Kingdom, and to teach us
> that the way to reconcile ourselves with God is by experiencing the events of
> our lives with an awareness of our purpose as human beings."

Following the essence of his lessons and examples are the best way to develop
the charitable qualities of our spirit and achieve our “salvation”.

## Understanding Jesus' message of Love
There are many Spiritist books that bring us an evolved understanding of Jesus'
examples and teachings, which he gave to the people of that time in stories and
parables

The greatest of all Spiritist resources for studying Jesus’ moral
teachings regarding issues such as God's laws, freedom from suffering, and
reaching the Divine Kingdom, is "The Gospel Explained by the Spiritist
Doctrine", one of the five books of the codification of the Spiritist Doctrine,
in which Kardec and the Superior Sprits that collaborated in its writing
interpret and explain various passages from the Bible

Spiritism not only helps us to understand Jesus' lessons, but also shows us that
by force of divine law, we will all achieve a complete state of evolution and
happiness. 

It is in this sense that the author Palhano Jr. writes that Spiritism:
>"does not assume the responsibility for the salvation of anyone, since it does
>not proclaim any eternal damnation to begin with. To the contrary, it says that
>everyone evolves, the good and the bad, some more slowly than others, depending
>on the efforts of each. It presents the resource of the Law of Reincarnation to
>justify the divine justice and mercy in light of the imperfections of men.
>Salvation, in the Spiritist view, is the illumination of man's heart, such that
>he may leave the state of spiritual infancy and progress towards God."
