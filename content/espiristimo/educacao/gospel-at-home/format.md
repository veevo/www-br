## Gospel At Home - Suggested Procedure
Here are some suggested procedures for a good **Gospel at Home** session:

### Step 1 - Start with a Complementary reading
Begin with your complementary reading, such as a Spiritist book of inspirational messages, to help everyone focus on the study you are to begin, leaving aside other concerns at that time.

### Step 2 - Initial Prayer
Then, someone from the group should say a simple opening prayer, during which time the the participants should elevate their their thoughts, in order to connect, mentally, with one another and with the good spirits.

If children are present, you may want to start their reading first, using the children's books. They should be encouraged to make comments about the reading and to participate in prayers, as well.
	     	
### Step 3 - Read a passage
You can now begin your reading of a passage from "The Gospel According to Spiritism".  Participants can take turns reading different pieces of the passage.  Then, participants can offer comments according to their understanding of the reading.

### Step 4 - Discuss the passage
They should also try to relate the lesson contained in the reading to the events of their daily lives.  If you are reading in sequence, you should take note of the place where you left off to begin there at the next meeting.

### Step 5 - Closing Prayer
End the meeting with a closing prayer, giving thanks for the blessings you have received, for this moment of study, and for the assistance of the good spirits.  Also, ask for assistance for friends and loved ones, as well as for others who are in need or who may be suffering.

### Step 6 - Drink the Magnetized water
Distribute the magnetized water among participants.

### Step 7 - Keep in Peace
After the meeting, maintain a vibration of inner peace, with elevated thoughts and conversations.  Discarnate spirits who may approach a home to participate in this kind of meeting, may also stay there for some time, observing each person's behavior.
