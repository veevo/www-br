## Gospel At Home - Benefits
Realizing the Gospel at Home is more than just studying the Gospel. Learn why.


### Moral And Spiritual Fortitude
The ethical teachings that are found within "The Gospel According to Spiritism" invite participants to pursue a conscious effort toward inner reform. The educational and inspirational lessons raise their awareness of their own moral strengths and weaknesses and encourage them to resist the negative tendencies that their spirits retain from previous lives, while instead making choices that reflect the more virtuous ideals with which they now they aspire to live.  In addition, when they encounter difficult moments in their lives, and thus find it harder to keep a positive attitude and maintain higher ethical standards, the lessons of the Gospel, when carried in their heart, will serve as a reminder and inspiration to make the extra effort necessary to follow those teachings that they studied during these Gospel At Home meetings and other moments of spiritist study.
	     	
### Strengthened Bond between Family/Household Members
Sharing this kind of experience and these moments of reflection helps the individuals to keep in touch with one another and to understand each other's perspectives, ideas, beliefs, etc. This helps them to cultivate understanding attitudes toward one another and strengthens the bonds of their relationships.

### Purification of the Home with Elevated Thoughts
The quality and nature of the energies that we emit are directly related to the quality of thoughts that we entertain.  When the members of a household join together to reflect upon the moral teachings of Spiritism, their thoughts are raised to a higher frequency, and they will, consequently, emit strong currents of positive, purifying energies which will replace those polluted by any negative or immoral thoughts entertained by family members during the previous week.  This works to restore the fluidic hygiene of the environment and to facilitate the work of the good spirits.

### Company and Assistance of Good Spirits
When we dedicate ourselves to morally edifying study and put into practice the lessons that educate our ethical character, thereby learning to concern ourselves with the well-being of others and the construction of harmonious relationships, we attract good spirits who observe our efforts and desire to help us to be successful. When participants work together to assist one another and to build a strong foundation of support, love, and understanding, the results are magnified.  The spirits that are called to their aid then work in favor of the family as a whole, guiding them with positive intuitions and helping to keep harmonious energies in the home.  These spirits, when present in the home for the Gospel At Home meetings, also help by working to cleanse the fluidic environment (energy) in the home and to magnetize the water that is set out before the meeting, impregnating the spiritual fluids of the water with healthy and fortifying energies.

### Education of Discarnate Spirits
With the regular practice of Gospel At Home meetings, the family members may begin to host an audience of discarnate spirits who will also be present during the meeting to learn from the readings and discussions. These are spirits in need of moral education or inspiration to step out of the shadows of despair precipitated by a fixation of their minds on something that caused them emotional suffering.  Just like the family members themselves, these spirits also need to learn about the God who loves all his children, the operation and justice of the natural laws that govern both the material and spiritual worlds, and the lessons left by Jesus as well as his love that continues with us at all moments.  Sometimes the spirits are drawn to the meeting on their own, and sometimes they are brought by higher spirits.  The fact that these spirits may be present is another reason for family members to always be aware of their behavior, especially on the meeting day, for their behaviors will be observed by these discarnate brothers and sisters, who can benefit from the household members' good examples.
