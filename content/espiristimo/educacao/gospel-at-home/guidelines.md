## Gospel At Home - Guidelines
Here are some suggested guidelines passed from the Spiritual Mentors to us:


### Consistency
The meeting needs to be held **on the same day, at the same time**, each week, in cooperation with the good spirits who make plans to be present in order to assist both the incarnate participants and the discarnate spirits who may come to learn with them.  Occasionally, the meeting may be held at a different time when needed due to special circumstances.  However, this should happen as little as possible.  If one or more members is unable to attend on the regular day, the other members can continue to hold the meeting.  If the whole family is traveling, it is permissible to do the meeting, wherever they are, if circumstances permit. 

### Duration
The approximate duration of the meeting should be **between 30 minutes to one hour**.

### Environment
The environment should be a place inside the home, where participants can **feel comfortable** and which allows for the open reading of books. If a household member is sick at the time, you can conduct the meeting where he is, if he would like. If desired, soft music can be played in the background. There is no need for any kind of special decor, candles, or other objects. The only item you are advised to have on the table, other than your books, is a pitcher of water to be magnetized, by the good spirits and the elevated thoughts of prayer, and distributed at the end of the meeting. If there is someone sick in the home, a special glass of water should be set out for him or her, to receive special energies.

### Suggested Bibliography
The book to be read should be "The Gospel According to Spiritism"ยน, and as a complementary reading, you can use a Spiritist book of inspirational messages, for example, to begin the meeting.  "The Gospel According to Spiritism" can be read by opening the book at random or in sequence, the latter being advised for those who do not presently participate in any other orderly/systematic study of the Spiritism.  Spiritist books for children can also be included if children are present.

### Preparation
Especially on the day of the meeting, participants should seek to maintain physical, emotional, and spiritual equilibrium, avoiding alcoholic drinks, heavy foods, mental exhaustion, arguments, and inappropriate behaviors. They should turn to the serenity of prayer and be vigilantly observant of their attitudes, in order to maintain the spiritual strength that this requires.

### During the Meeting
Once the meeting begins, it should not be interrupted for phone calls or other activities.  If someone arrives late, they can be invited to join the group.
