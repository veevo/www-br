## Spirit
The essential nature of spirit has yet to be revealed to humans. But one can think of a spirit as “the intelligent principle of the universe” with their individual qualities, virtues, deffects and particular intelligence.

Spirit is not matter. However, the union between spirit and matter is necessary to provide the spirit with tools to manifest itself, learn and progress. From the human perspective, since our senses aren’t designed to perceive spirits apart from matter, this union is also necessary for the manifestation of intelligent activity.  

**Spirits are the intelligent beings of the universe**, created by God "simple and ignorant" but destinated to be perfect, pure and happy as the model and guide of humanity, Jesus.

Spirits can be either **incarnate** (incorporated in a material body and living in the material world) or as **discarnate** (freed from a material body and living in the spiritual realm).
