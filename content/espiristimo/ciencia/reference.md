## References
Because we're talking science, let's show the references:



In a book called [Genesis](/books/allan-kardec/genesis), [Allan Kardec](/profiles/allan-kardec) its author and responsible for this research, explains on Chapter 14:

» The cosmic fluid is the fundamental constituent of all matter. 

» The cosmic fluid assumes **two extreme states**, with a gradient of variations between the two. One state is **materialization**, which leads to the phenomena of the visible/material world. The other is **etherealization** which produces the phenomena of the invisible world. 

» All modifications of the fluid, whether perceptible to us or not, are considered matter and can be found in an infinite range of degrees of purity tangible to us or not.  

» Some modifications of the fluid are known as spiritual fluids and form the matter of the spiritual world. Many of these spiritual fluids escape the perception of our human senses and instruments. Other variations are intimately tied to the corporeal life.

» The fluids that are closest to the materialization are the least pure. They make up the the spiritual atmosphere of the Earth and are in constant interaction with the material realm, whereby they affect, and are affected by, the beings that inhabit it.
