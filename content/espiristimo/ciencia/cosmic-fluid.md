## The Cosmic Fluid
The **cosmic fluid, or cosmic principle**, is the irreducible and fundamental constituent of all matter.  It is essentially a more  refined form of matter with an independent existence of its own.  Every form of matter as we know it, as well as the energy phenomena that we know of today, such as heat, magnetism, and electricity are only modifications of this basic element.  

**The cosmic fluid holds properties common to both spirit and matter serving as an intermediary between them**. This allows the spirit to act on matter. It also means that manipulations on the cosmic fluid can be used to produce an infinite number of things or phenomena. Some we know, some we still no idea about.

### But What about vaccuum?
Remember when we said that the minimum particle already found by science is still very far from being the most elementary element? There is no vaccum. All Universe is filled with this semi-material fluid we described as **cosmic fluid**.

Now, let's see where all this science comes from?
