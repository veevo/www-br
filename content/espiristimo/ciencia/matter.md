## Matter
From the human point of view, matter is generally conceived of as something that occupies space, can be perceived by one or more senses, and is impenetrable. However **matter exists in states unknown to us** even if being too ethereal to make an impression on our senses.

The other key point to understand about matter is that **it is formed of one basic element**.  The elements that we regard as basic (such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and their chemical/physical building blocks) are really **transformations of a more fundamental matter: the cosmic fluid**. 

Basically, matter has only two essential properties: force and movement. All other properties conditioned by intensity, direction, and movement, are only secondary effects responding to different molecular arrangements.  These secondary effects, such as flavors, colors, sounds, poisonous vs. medicinal qualities, etc., occur when elementary molecules undergo changes due to the interaction and combination with other molecules, or in response to environmental pressure.

Any of that is new and all of it has already been proven by science.

However, what science has yet to prove is that the minimum particle already found is still very far from being the most elementary element.
