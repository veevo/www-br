Public meetings are meetings in which one person (or two) speaks to an audience
about a topic, often of a [Gospel](/gospel)-related theme.

Normally, one such meeting is held at least one day per week, but they may be
held on multiple days or multiple times in one day, depending on the size of the
center.  In addition, there may be similar meetings held at other times as well,
in which the topic is of a different nature, but within the scope and teachings
of [Spiritism](/spiritism).

## Lecturers
Those who perform such lectures are not ordained or "certified" preachers, but
rather those who have studied Spiritism well, and as such, are prepared and
willing to share their knowledge with others.  

Lecturers are scheduled in advance and are assigned a topic for which they must
prepare before presenting.  

Often times, guest lecturers from other centers are called in to speak, either
at regularly scheduled meetings or at special seminars.

## Fluidic Therapy Session
Following the regular public meetings, a [fluidic therapy
session](../fluidic-therapy) is usually held for those who wish to participate.  

These meetings are an excellent way for those who are new to
[Spiritism](/spiritism) to learn more about what it teaches and what the
Spiritist center is like.  

For those who are not new, it is a great way to come together, fraternally, with
others who share the same beliefs and common goals.  

For all participants, it is a valuable resource for education and lessons that
help us in our efforts toward inner reform and growth, as well as a source of
harmonizing energy offered through the fluidic therapy sessions.
