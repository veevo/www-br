Fluid Therapy is a practice of magnetization that involves the transmission, or
donation of positive, restorative energies/fluids that help to revitalize and
re-balance those of the patient. Normally, it refers to the utilization of a
technique involving “hand passes” as well as magnetized water.   At the
Spiritist center, you may also hear this referred to  as "passes", “spiritual
healing” or “bioenergetic therapy”. 

You can read more about Fluidic Therapy by reading the section titled "Intro to
Fluidic Therapy", found in the web section for the scientific aspect of
Spiritism.
