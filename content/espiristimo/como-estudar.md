## How to Study Spiritism

The study of the Spiritist codification is most effective when done in groups of like-minded individuals. The purpose of this study is not just to answer people’s questions but also to encourage the asking of new ones and the sharing of the conclusions each individual reaches from the studied material. None of these benefits can be achieved when the student is always alone during the study sessions.

In terms of personal growth, working in groups is essential. The Law of Society means that only by sharing , helping others and receiving the same can any learning be applied. The obstacles, trials and conflicts that can result from groups are critical to practicing indulgence, cooperation, awareness and learning from others. And certainly charity, compassion and love cannot be learned, taught or practiced in an environment of isolation, and these three virtues are vital to any personal progress.

For mediums a third benefit comes from Spiritist centers as discussed in the section on the ‘Evolution of Mediumship’ (part of the Mediumship Guide) . Attending a center’s general meetings, study groups and mediumship development sessions is critical to the development, refinement and control of a mediumship gift. And only through this refinement can this tool be used to its full potential as a tool for good and enlightenment of others.

If study groups or Spiritist Centers are out of reach or you wish to begin study of the codification alone here are some suggestions:

– Before each study session find a way to relax, you can do anything you find effective like pray or meditate it is up to you.

– Pick a quiet place to study, one far from distractions like TVs, radios or people. And try to hold every study session in that same place.

– Begin by studying The Spirits’ Book, then The Mediums Book and then the Gospel According To Spiritism. The last two books can be studied in what ever order you wish.

– Study each book in small sections. With the Spirits Book for example don’t review more than 2 questions at a time. It is important that time be taken to think about what is being read and reach conclusions or come up with more personal questions.

– Have a note book as part of your study sessions. Write down all your ideas, comments, conclusions and questions about each part of the books as you read them.

– If you are confused by a part of what you are reading, first try reading it more than once, any words that you might be confused about can be looked up in a dictionary, and if that does not work, skip on to the next section and come back to it later.

– Realistically even if you have studied the codification by yourself, you will eventually have to find like minded individuals in order to gain a deeper understanding of the many many ideas brought forth in these works. Even if you are not a Spiritist, nor ever intent to become one. You can find a Spiritist Center near you and join it’s study group. Such study groups are open to everyone and of course free of charge.

– If you are serious about the study of these books understand that even in study groups each book of the codification is studied more than once. Each time they are studies something new will be learned.
