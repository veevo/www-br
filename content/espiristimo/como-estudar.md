Spiritism provides a way of thinking, a way of living, a way of clearly
understanding these crisis and doubts that seem to plague our lives. Most
importantly, revealing our continued existence after our deaths, and how
learning, growing and personal progressing continues until our fullest potential
is achieved.

Unlike any religious [dogma](/about/dogma), Spiritism does not demand blind
[faith](/about/faith); on the contrary, it asks students to always use reason
and good sense, and to ask questions.  It also tells us why we should strive for
an ethical way of living.

Spiritism proves the existence of God, God’s laws and God’s role in our lives
not with myth, fear and ritual, but under the lights of [science and
philosophy](../science-philosophy-religion).


## Why study Spiritism?
There isn’t a time in our lives when we don’t need answers. Life is filled with
obstacles and suffering that make it seem like we are alone, helpless and living
a pointless life.  In the times of great tragedy and loss in our lives we are
filled with doubt about the existence of God, the afterlife and if trying to be
a better person has any real reward or is just idealist folly.

Spiritism is a critical tool for living, for anyone who looks at human life,
their own lives, and dares to ask why.

## The Essential Works
The base of Spiritism consists of [5 books usually called the Spiritist
Codification](../codification) put to paper by the French educator [Allan
Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec) in the 1850s.  These books contain detailed
explanations regarding [spirits](/about/spirit) and [mediumistic
phenomena](../mediumship), [the laws God created](/divine-laws) for our
spiritual growth, the methodology of life’s daily trials, the different levels
of spirit evolution, a rediscovery of the misunderstood ethical truths taught by
[Jesus](/about/jesus), details of how the universe and Spirits were created and
what God has in store for all of us.

Since the 1850s until present times [thousands of books](/books) have and
continue to be published about Spiritism and all its implications in every
aspect of modern life from human psychology to genetic research.  Most books are
transcribed by a [Spiritist medium](/about/medium) and come from [superior
spirits](/about/superior-spirit) in the noble service of God.

## Where to Practice?
The study of the Spiritist codification is most effective when done in groups of
like-minded individuals in a [Spiritist Center](../centers).

The purpose of the study is not just to answer people’s questions but also to
encourage asking questions and sharing the conclusions each individual reaches
from the studied material.  None of these benefits can be achieved if the
student is alone during the study sessions.

For more information, check the [How to Practice article](../how-to-practice).

## Expected Behaviour
Below, we provide some information regarding the essential changes in the
behaviour a person desiring to improve their life trough Spiritism should have.

### Reflexive Studies
It is also highly recommended that the studies are applied
[reflexively](/about/reflexive-study) Essentially, we should assume that every
information we read was offered to us by the [spiritual
mentors](/about/spiritual-guide) for our own self-improvement.

For example, by reading romances like [Paul and
Stephen](/books/paul-and-stephen) or [Memoirs of a
Suicide](/books/memoirs-of-a-suicide), one should think how they would act if
they were on that situation.

### Personal Growth
In terms of personal growth, working in groups is essential. Spiritits are
encouraged to not only study the [Codification](../codification) itself, but
also knowing, understanding and _practicing_ the [essential virtues](/virtues)
in order to respect, live and love the [divine laws](/divine-laws) associated to
them.

For example, [the Law of Society](/divine-laws/society) means that only by
sharing, helping others and receiving the same can any learning be applied.

### Handling Conflicts
The obstacles, trials and conflicts that can result from groups are critical to
practicing [indulgence](/virtues/indulgence), cooperation, awareness and
learning from others.

And certainly [charity](/virtues/charity), [compassion](/virtues/compassion) and
[love](/virtues/love) cannot be learned, taught or practiced in an environment
of isolation, and these three virtues are vital to any personal progress.

### Measusing Progress
In every life there comes a moment(s) in which we find ourselves forced to
confront our faults and ethical limitations. For most this moment is met
initially with anger, then contemplation, doubt and finally resignation that
self-improvement is beyond their reach.

What we do not realize is the immense importance of these moments. As we
continue through the long path of intellectual and ethical evolution we all
reach many moments of impasse. These evolutionary impasses come when we are
unable to recognize our personal faults and/or lack the clarity, willingness, or
method for changing these faults. As humans and as spirits we live in an ironic
paradox, every aspect of our existence is based on change yet we seem to
instinctively despise change.

In order for us to be spurred on to deal with these impasses we repeatedly
choose trials and obstacles in our reincarnations so that we are forced to again
face these faults and again strive to the needed change. So when a person
reaches one of these moments and chooses to remain unchanged they become the
authors of their own tragedy. Placing themselves once again in the cycle of
trial, mistake, contemplation, stagnation and then choosing to try again with
even tougher trials in the next reincarnation.

Through self evaluation we provide ourselves a tool that we can use every day to
help gain clarity as to our faults and virtues, failures and successes and as
what we need to concentrate on to improve. An excellent exercise in evaluation
is to take a half hour every evening, find a quiet secluded space, meditate and
start to ask yourself a series of questions like the ones below.

* “Have I learned anything today?” 
* “Have I harmed anyone today?” 
* “Have I helped anyone today?” 
* “Have I done anything unselfish today?” 
* “Have I made a friend today?” 
* “Have I made an enemy today?” 
* “Have I tried to make amends to someone I wronged today?” 
* “Have I shown compassion today?” 
* “How did I treat my family today?” 
* “How did I treat my friends and coworkers today?” 
* “How did I treat strangers today?” 
* “What mistakes have I made today?”.

It’s important to be honest in answering these questions and let the answers be
your guide for the next day. In addition it might be useful to keep a daily or
weekly journal to write down your thoughts, ideas, questions and to record your
progress.

## Studying Alone
What if you don't have access to a [Spiritist Center](../centers)?

If study groups or Spiritist Centers are out of reach or you wish to begin study
of the codification alone here are some suggestions:

* Before each study session find a way to relax, you can do anything you find
  effective like pray or meditate it is up to you.
* Pick a quiet place to study, one far from distractions like TVs, radios or
  people. And try to hold every study session in that same place.
* Begin by studying The Spirits’ Book, then The Mediums Book and then the Gospel
  According To Spiritism. The last two books can be studied in what ever order
  you wish.
* Study each book in small sections. With the Spirits Book for example don’t
  review more than 2 questions at a time. It is important that time be taken to
  think about what is being read and reach conclusions or come up with more
  personal questions.
* Have a note book as part of your study sessions. Write down all your ideas,
  comments, conclusions and questions about each part of the books as you read
  them.
* If you are confused by a part of what you are reading, first try reading it
  more than once, any words that you might be confused about can be looked up in
  a dictionary, and if that does not work, skip on to the next section and come
  back to it later.
* Realistically even if you have studied the codification by yourself, you will
  eventually have to find like minded individuals in order to gain a deeper
  understanding of the many many ideas brought forth in these works. Even if you
  are not a Spiritist, nor ever intent to become one. You can find a Spiritist
  Center near you and join it’s study group. Such study groups are open to
  everyone and of course free of charge.

– If you are serious about the study of these books understand that even in
study groups each book of the codification is studied more than once. Each time
they are studies something new will be learned.

## Gospel at Home
The [Gospel at Home](../gospel-at-home) is another essential and very important
tool for practicing and studying Spiritism. It is a moment for the family to get
together, learn and connect with their [spiritual
guides](/about/spiritual-guide).

Read the [Gospel at Home](../gospel-at-home) section to understand more.
