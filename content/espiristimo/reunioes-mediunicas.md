Mediumship Sessions are meetings that are not open to the public and are held
with a consistent group of disciplined [mediums](/about/medium) who are
knowledgeable in Spiritism and who have been prepared to work together, along
with at least one spirit mentor who also works consistently with the group.

Such meetings may be held for different objectives. However, they are always of
a serious nature, with the general goal of fraternal, spiritual assistance.

They typically offer counseling, instruction, and friendly support to suffering
spirits who come to communicate, some of whom are brought to the meeting by
higher spirits.  In some cases, help is offered to spirits who are involved in a
negative and harmful relationship with an incarnate or another disincarnate
spirit who is seeking help at the Spiritist center.
