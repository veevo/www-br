## Conception and Birth
Question 351 of "The Spirits' Book" asks, "During the time between conception and birth, does a spirit have the use of all its faculties?"  The spirits replied, "To some degree. It depends on the stage of gestation at which the physical body has arrived.  As yet, the spirit still has not fully incarnated in the new body; it is only attached to it.  From the moment of conception, however, a change takes place in the spirit  ̶  a state of confusion, signaling that the time has come for it to enter a new life.  This condition becomes more and more pronounced until the time of birth.  Between the two periods, that is, while its new body is in the womb, the spirit's state is similar to that of a sleeping person.  As the moment of birth approaches, its thoughts and ideas fade away.  So do memories of the past; once incarnated, the spirit will no longer be conscious of those memories.  Once it returns to the spirit-world, though, this memory will come back to it, little by little."¹ 
	  	
Kardec writes, in "Genesis":

> "From the moment [the spirit] is caught up in the fluidic tie that holds it to the fetus, it enters a state of perturbation that increases as the the attachment tightens, and the spirit, in the last moments, loses all consciousness of itself, with such luck that it never 'witnesses' its own birth.  When the child breathes, the spirit begins to recover its faculties, which develop in proportion to the formation and consolidation of the organs that will serve it in its manifestations [of its faculties]." 

At this point, we would not say, strictly speaking, that the developing fetus has a soul, but rather that the incarnation is in process, and that the fetus is linked to the spirit that will inhabit it.  Regarding the nature of life in the womb, the spirits said that "it is akin to vegetative  ̶  that is, unconscious functioning  ̶  though it already has a biological life.  Its union with the spirit at birth adds a spiritual one."


## The union of the Spirit with the Physical Body
As you will recall from the identically titled segment in our section on the perispirit (see menu bar at left), the union of the soul with the material body of the child to be born, is carried out through the perispirit, which will serve as a tie between the spirit and the matter.  Remember that the spirit is first tied to the embryo through a fluidic bond or "cord", which is actually an extension of the perispirit, that attracts it with an irresistible force, from the moment of conception; as the embryo develops, the fluidic cord shortens, and the perispirit is joined, molecule by molecule, to the embryo.  

In an extremely varied and complex mechanism, either through the action of the reincarnating spirit, or through the action of its spiritual benefactors, the perispirit is reduced, condensed and assimilated to the material molecules.  The perispirit becomes a fluidic mold that acts upon the body in formation, together with the hereditary conditions, the maternal mental influence, and the action of the benefactors that collaborate in the reincarnatory process.
