## Forgetfulness of Past

While incarnated, we experience the "veil of forgetfulness" that blinds us, temporarily, to the events of our past incarnations. This is actually a blessing from God, for if we were actually able to remember such events, these memories could greatly amplify our suffering and cause a great obstacle to making any progress in the present. God allows us this gift, then, in order to give us a fair opportunity to undergo our trials and expiations with success.
