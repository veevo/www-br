## Spiritual Guides

Another way that God shows his justice and helps us to make good decisions is by giving us spirit guides. These are spirits of a higher level¹ who act as "big brothers and sisters", by helping to protect us from danger, offering good advice to lead us in the right direction, consoling us in our suffering, and encouraging us to have faith and confidence. Each of us has a particular mentor, or spirit guide, assigned to us. This spirit guide accompanies us from birth to death, often into the spirit-life after death, and even through several successive incarnations.  

Note: You can read more about these spirit guides in "The Spirits' Book", Chapter XIII.
