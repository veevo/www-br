## Trials, Expiations, and Missions

Throughout the process of its evolution, a spirit's incarnations will offer it experiences for trials, expiations, and in the case of highly evolved spirits, a special mission. Trials allow the spirit to put its learning and knowledge to the test. They can come in both the form of difficult experiences that test, for example, one's humility, honesty, resignation or compassion, or in the form of apparent blessings such as wealth or talents to test whether or not the spirit will use it to help others. 

It is through expiations and the sufferings, both of physical and spiritual nature, either chosen or imposed, that the spirit may make amends for past mistakes. Lastly, in some cases, the spirit may incarnate with a mission, by which it is charged with some task to complete in benefit of the progression of humanity.
