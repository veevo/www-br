## Necessity of Material Life

Some ask why we can't undergo our necessary learning experiences in the spiritual plane. What is it that is special about the material life that makes it beneficial to our purification and growth?  The answer is found in the design of the natural law that requires us to learn certain lessons and obligates us to undergo circumstances. The latter can only be afforded by the material life, where we experience both the physical body and the societal factors found in the material realms.

The following experiences that aid in our evolution are afforded by the material body:

* The cleansing of our spiritual impurities through the suffering brought about by organic deficiencies: In each life we use a different physical body, the constitution of which depends on the the behavior of the spirit, its work, and its acts in previous lives, resulting in physical differences, such as: degree of health, perfect or imperfect organs, strength of memory, capability to learn and employ the acquired knowledge in human activity, etc.  All depend on the merit and objectives of the spirit, through the intermediary of the perispirit.  The perispirit acts as the spirit's memory archive and imprints the needed deficiencies and/or abilities upon this instrument of work, the material body.

* Containment or restriction of inferior tendencies developed in a past life, or lives, through present physical deficiencies and limitations. For example one who used a powerful intelligence in a previous life to bring harm to others, may reincarnate with a mental handicap. A person who used their physical force to act in brutal, viscous violence may reincarnate with physical deficiencies that limit his or her ability to act.

* Motivation to work when faced with the need to sustain the physical body, under the inspiration of the instinct of conservation, and the will to provide for the well-being of others as well.

* The ability to overcome inhibiting or paralyzing fixations (in terms of evolutionary progress), through the shock of a material rebirth that imposes a temporary forgetfulness of the past.

* A chance to reconcile ill feelings and discord shared with others, as a result of events in a past incarnation, by coming together in the present incarnation through family ties or the sharing of a home.

* An opportunity to prove the acquisition of moral values cultivated in the spiritual realm, through experiences in the material life that test one's ability to demonstrate such values.  

* An opportunity to exercise the value that we place on life by taking care of our human body, through healthy habits and proper judgment regarding the activities we become involved in.

Life in the material realm, at least at the level of evolution found on Earth, also involves societal issues that stem from the great levels of social, intellectual, moral, racial, and material inequalities.  

* In some cases, such inequalities offer the chance for the haves to avoid the temptations of selfishness and pride, to cultivate compassion and demonstrate charitable qualities by reaching out to help the have-nots, and likewise for the have-nots to work hard for what they desire, to accept, with humility and appreciation, help from the haves, and to accept, with resignation, that which is beyond their control.   

* In other cases, our differences offer the chance to learn how to respect those who are different, to recognize them as brothers and sisters under our one creator, and to even appreciate what someone who is different has to teach us. 

* In all cases, they are a chance for us to practice fraternity and work together for the common good and the progress of humanity as a whole.
