## WHAT IS SPIRITISM ?

»  Spiritism is a lesson of love and everlasting life, in a continued pursuit of self-improvement, and harmony, with all the creation throughout multiple existences.  
»  It is the collection of principles and laws, as revealed by the Superior Spirits, contained in the works of Allan Kardec, which constitute the Codification of Spiritism: The Spirits' Book, The Mediums' Book, The Gospel According to Spiritism, Heaven and Hell, and Genesis.  
»  It is the promised Consoler which came, at the appointed time, to compliment and remind us of what Jesus taught, "reestablishing all things in their true meaning", so bringing to Humanity the true basis for spiritualization.  

### WHAT DOES SPIRITISM REVEAL ?

»  It reveals new and more profound concepts with respect to God, the universe, mankind, the spirits and the laws which govern life.  
»  Even more, it reveals what we are, from where we have originated, to where we shall go, and the cause of our pains and sufferings.  
»  Spiritism touches on all areas of human knowledge, of all activities and the behavior of Human Beings.  

### Science, a philosophy, and a religion
Spiritism is at the same time **science, a philosophy, and religion**.

The science of Spiritism studies the existence and nature of spirits, which are nothing more than the immortal souls of men, created by God.

The philosophy, which was derived from a serious study of information received in communications with discarnate spirits, deals with the details of spirit life and the journey of evolution through the process reincarnation. A natural consequence of that that philosophy is the understanding of the role we play in our own spiritual evolution, which is ultimately achieved through the efforts we make to grow, both morally and intellectually.

Spiritism helps us to understand the natural laws that govern that process of evolution. From a moral perspective, we follow the teachings and examples of Jesus Christ, as our model and guide.

The religious aspect stems from the moral ties between ourselves, and others, and the direction that Spiritism leads us, toward God, our creator, by helping us to understand life and by teaching us, ultimately, how to develop the ability to love, in the greatest sense of the word.
