## Understanding Jesus' Lessons
There are many Spiritist books that bring us an evolved understanding of Jesus' examples and teachings, which he gave to the people of that time in stories and parables.  The greatest of all Spiritist resources for studying Jesus’ moral teachings regarding issues such as God's laws, freedom from suffering, and reaching the Divine Kingdom, is "The Gospel Explained by the Spiritist Doctrine", one of the five books of the codification of the Spiritist Doctrine, in which Kardec and the Superior Sprits that collaborated in its writing interpret and explain various passages from the Bible.  

Spiritism not only helps us to understand Jesus' lessons, but also shows us that by force of divine law, we will all achieve a complete state of evolution and happiness. It is in this sense that the author Palhano Jr. writes that Spiritism
>"does not assume the responsibility for the salvation of anyone, since it does not proclaim any eternal damnation to begin with. To the contrary, it says that everyone evolves, the good and the bad, some more slowly than others, depending on the efforts of each. It presents the resource of the Law of Reincarnation to justify the divine justice and mercy in light of the imperfections of men. Salvation, in the Spiritist view, is the illumination of man's heart, such that he may leave the state of spiritual infancy and progress towards God."
