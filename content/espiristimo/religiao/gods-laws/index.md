## Introduction
Spiritism helps us to understand the process of spiritual growth and explains the concurrent and interdependent nature that marks the development of our knowledge, free-will, and corresponding level of responsibility for our actions.  To the degree that we acquire an increasingly greater understanding of God's laws, we are also held accountable for our attitudes and behaviors.  

We are often unaware about the ultimate state of moral and intellectual advancement that we, as spirits, are destined to achieve. This advancement is a design in the inevitable process of evolution.  As we go through life's challenges and struggles, however, we do seek to find comfort for our pains, escape from our miseries, and sources of inner-peace and happiness.
