## Introduction
[Spiritism](/spiritism) is not actually a separate, distinct religion. There are no churches, no dogmas, mysteries, rituals, or initiations, and there exists no priestly or ministerial hierarchy.

At the same time, the spirits who brought us the teachings of Spiritism did not come to destroy any religion or make Spiritism the only one. Their objective was to reveal the undiscovered (or forgotten) [laws of nature](/divine-laws) and to prove, by demonstration, what other religions teach only in theory: [soul](/about/soul), [the afterlife](/about/), compensation for [Earthly miseries of this world](/spiritism/science), etc.
