##   Prayers of Appreciation, Praise, and Reverence 
We're not always asking for something when we pray. The other two elements are appreciation and praise. It is important that we thank God for the many blessings that we have in our lives, be they welcomed, positive, events, or blessings in disguise through trials that will help us grow. And again, this isn't for God. It is for us. Giving thanks on a daily basis keeps us focused on the positive side of events.

Too often, when all is going well, we start taking several things for granted.  We forget about God's graciousness until tragedy strikes and we experience something that jolts us with the realization of how short and precious life is, bringing us to thank God for the sound of a loved one's voice, the warmth of the sun's rays, or the chance to reach out and help a neighbor in need.  Let's not wait for these events to happen to remind us how lucky we are. Let's remember and be thankful in our prayers every day.

Likewise, our prayers can include a statement of reverence, as Jesus taught us in the Lord's prayer, with the opening verse, "Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be thy name." We often begin a prayer with such a phrase, praising God for his benevolence and justice, lifting to our creator our respectful and appreciative thoughts, with faith and sincerity.  Praying with both praise and appreciation for God's justice and benevolence will help us to maintain a mindset that strengthens our affinity with good spirits.
