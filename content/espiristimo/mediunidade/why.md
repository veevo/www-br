## Why are we mediums?
As [previously said](who-is-medium), mediumship is a native aspect of every person and has a different purpose on each of us. See below what they are.

### Learning
Mediumship is an important tool for learning, amplifying the mediums virtues and vices. Giving the medium an opportunity to learn from this new awareness of [God](/about/god), the Spirit and the [spirit world](/about/spiritual-world). And to learn from all that comes with developing, and practicing the gift.

### Expiation
Mediumship gives the medium a unique opportunity to pay off past debts. If the medium chooses to use their ability to do good then the [expiation](/about/expiation) is two fold. First because of the self sacrifice and overcoming of temptation needed to make such a choice, and second from the constant works of charity performed when the gift is used to help others.

### Revelation
Mediumship is a precious instrument for revealing to people the truths about God, the [immortality of the soul](/about/sould), [Godâ€™s laws](/divine-laws), the existence of the [spirit world](/about/spiritual-world) and the [after life](/about/erraticity).

### Information
Mediumship is a channel for [thousands of books](/books) on all aspects of life in the physical and spirit world. It also provides information directly from Spirits to individuals who need this guidance.

### Healing
Trough Mediumship a medium can provide healing energy from the spiritual realm to cure needy individuals.
