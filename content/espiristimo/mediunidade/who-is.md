## Who is a medium?
> "Everyone who is, to any degree, influenced by spirits is, by that very fact, a medium.  This faculty is inherent in man, and is therefore no exclusive privilege;  therefore, rare are those who do not possess some rudiments of the faculty.  We may, therefore, assume that everyone is more or less a medium." <br> <br>
> [The Mediums' Book](/books/allan-kaderc/mediums-book), item #159  

In other words, **everyone is a medium** altough in different degrees. That said, all of use carry the potential to communicate with the [spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world). This 6th sense is more developed in some individuals than others and is unrelated to the [level of progression](/about/spiritual-progression) a spirit has.


### Future
In the future, the mediumistic faculty will have evolved on our planet to the point where it becomes common to everyone. Because that day is still very distant it's common that today, when we speak of "mediums", we refer to those whom, according to Kardec, the medianimic faculty is "practically applicable" and is "clearly characterized, producing well-marked results."
