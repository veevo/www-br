### Clairvoyant and Somnambulic Mediums
Seeing mediums are those who see spirits. This faculty is rare and is seldom permanent.

Normally, when we refer to seeing mediums, we refer to those who possess this faculty in their normal state, when they are perfectly awake, and who preserve an exact recollection of what they have seen.  The seeing mediums that are referred to as clairvoyant are those who see with great clarity, and who do so just the same with their eyes open or closed. They may feel as if they are seeing with their bodily eyes, but in reality, it is with the eyes of their soul that they see, through the action of their perispirit.  Proof of this is found in the seeing mediums who are blind, materially speaking, but are able to see spirits and things of the spiritual realm.  There are some mediums who see only with their eyes open; Rigonatti describes this saying that "the cause of their sight resides in their eyes, which become sensitive under the fluidic action of the spirit that wants to be seen by the medium. In this state of optic sensibility, the medium sees in thought."

Though we normally refer to seeing mediums who see spirits while awake, as Kardec points out, there are those who only see spirits in a somnambulic state, or one bordering on it.  (See somnambulic mediums on menu bar at left).  Kardec also says that we may also include, in the category of seeing mediums, those endowed with second-sight, also called double vision, which takes place when the liberation of the soul occurs in the waking state.  (See somnambulic mediums on menu bar at left, subsection Second Sight ).  Regarding the vision of spirits in dreams, Kardec says that it "undoubtedly results from a sort of medianimity, but, properly speaking, it does not constitute the "seeing medium." 


### Hearing Mediums
Hearing mediums are those who hear the voices of spirits. This is a common type of mediumistic faculty.  As the spirit desiring to communicate approaches one such medium, and the two of them establish a fluidic connection (via their perispirits), there are two ways in which this medium could hear the spirit's "voice".  Sometimes, the perispirit of the medium receives the thought of the spirit, and the medium feels it as if it were an inner voice, speaking to his inner consciousness.  Other times, the connection between the communicating spirit and the medium occurs in such a way so as to make an impression on the auditory nerves of the medium. In this case, the medium hears the "voice" of the spirit as an external voice, just as if he were hearing the voice of another person.

A hearing medium may be able hear the voice of spirits in both ways or only one.  The medium can converse with the spirits, acting as an interpreter to pass on to other incarnates what the spirit wishes to say  ̶  either by repeating the message or writing it down. These mediums are very common.  

### Speaking Mediums
The faculty exercised by speaking mediums, also called psychophony, is that which permits a spirit to act upon and utilize the vocal organs of the incarnate medium to verbally transmit its message.  In other words, the spirit utilizes the vocal organs, and essentially the physical body, of the medium as an instrument to communicate via the spoken word, with accompanying gestures.  In this way, the spirit is able to converse "directly" with the incarnate persons who are present. 

In order for this to happen, the medium enters into a mediumistic trance that allows the bonds between his spirit and his material body to loosen, whereby his spirit temporarily disengages¹ from the physical body, thereby "loaning", so to speak, his body to the communicating spirit.

¹ though only partially, i.e. always remains connected via a fluidic "chord", since complete separation would mean death.


### Writing Mediums
The faculty exercised by writing mediums, also called psychography, is that which permits a spirit to act upon and utilize the arm and hand of the incarnate medium to transmit its message through writing.   Sometimes, the mediums hand and arm may be used in some kind of gesture such as becoming agitated convulsively or striking the table angrily, though as Kardec notes, this always denotes the presence of imperfect spirits. 

Like the process that takes place in psychophony, in order for this to happen, the medium enters into a mediumistic trance that allows the bonds between his spirit and his material body to loosen, whereby his spirit temporarily disengages from the physical body¹, thereby "loaning", so to speak, his body¹ to the communicating spirit.

¹ though only partially, i.e. always remains connected via a fluidic "chord", since complete separation would mean death.


### Intuitive Mediums
Intuitive mediums are found among the mediums through whom spirits speak and write, though we put them here in a separate category, in order to distinguish the mechanism involved.  As mentioned in a previous topic (see Speaking and Writing Mediums), the mediums known as conscious and unconscious speaking mediums, as well as mechanical and semi-mechanical writing mediums, exercise a mediumistic faculty that involves the direct action of the spirit upon parts of their physical body, though always with a simultaneous mental connection.  In the intuitive medium, the spirit acts only upon the incarnate soul, with which it temporarily identifies. The intuitive medium is one who captures the thoughts of the spirits.   


### Inspired Mediums
Inspired mediums, such as Allan Kardec himself, are those to whom the spirits suggest thoughts. They are a variety of the intuitive mediums, the difference being that in the inspired medium, the action of the spirits upon the medium is so subtle that even the medium himself does not feel it and only perceives that he is being helped in his ideas.  Consequently, it is even more difficult than with the intuitive medium to distinguish the medium's thought from that which is suggested.

We find the following description in "The Medium's Book" (items 182-183):

> The peculiar characteristic of the inspirational medium is spontaneity.  And here let us remark that inspiration comes to us all, from spirits who influences us, for good or for evil, in every circumstance of our lives, and in every resolution we make, and it may therefore be truly said that, in this respect, everyone is a medium..... <br><br>
> It is evident that we may include in this category the persons who, without being endowed with superior intelligence, and without any modification of their normal state, have flashes of intellectual lucidity which give them, for the moment, an unusual faculty of conception and of expression, and sometimes a presentiment of future events.  In what are rightly spoken of as "moments of inspiration," the flow of ideas is abundant, through the action of an involuntary, spontaneous, and almost feverish impulsion; it appears to us, at such times, as though some superior intelligence had come to our aid, and our mind seems to have been suddenly relieved of a burden.   <br><br>
> All those who are possessed of genius − artists, poets, scientific discoverers, great writers, etc, are doubtless spirits of superior advancement, able to comprehend and to conceive great ideas; and it is precisely because of this ability that the spirits who desire the accomplishment of some particular work select them as their instruments, suggesting to their minds the trains of thought required for their special ends, so that, in a majority of cases, "men of genius" are mediums without being aware of it.  Many of them, however, have a vague intuition of this extraneous help, and everyone who seeks inspiration performs, unconsciously, an act of evocation, whenever he makes an appeal to his good genius to come to his aid.

Kardec then adds a couple of questions that were asked to the spirits, along with the answers that were given by the latter:
> - Is inspiration confined to the revelation of great things?  
> " No; it often has reference to the most commonplace circumstances of your daily life.  For instance, you may have thought of going somewhere, but a secret voice tells you not to go, because of a danger that is likely to be encountered; or it tells you to do something which you have not thought of doing; this is inspiration.  There are very few persons who are not more or less 'inspired' in this way, at certain moments" <br><br>
> - May authors painters, musicians, and so on, be considered, in their moments of inspiration, as mediums?  
>"Yes, for in such times, their soul is more free, more disengaged from matter, and recovers a  portion of its spiritual faculties; and it therefore receives, with greater facility, the communications of other spirits who inspire it with their own suggestions." 

### The Somnambulic Medium
Now that we have a general idea of what a somnambulist is, we can define the somnambulic medium.  We know that a medium, in general, acts as the instrument of an intelligence exterior to himself.  Likewise, as Kardec writes, "The spirit who communicates through an ordinary medium may do so through a somnambulist, the soul-emancipation of somnambulism often rendering spirit-communication even easier" ("Medium's Book" #172).  When acting as a medium then, the somnambulist is passive, and what he says does not come from himself.   In other words, when speaking to us, the somnambulist reveals his own knowledge and relates the perceptions of his own spirit, while the somnambulic medium expresses the thoughts of another.

To demonstrate the difference between the somnambulist and the somnambulistic medium, we can refer to the example given by Kardec in "The Mediums' Book" (#173).  He writes:

    A friend of ours had a somnambulic subject, a lad of about fourteen years of age, of very limited intelligence, and very imperfectly educated.  But, in the somnambulic state, he gave proofs of extraordinary lucidity and great penetration.  He excelled especially in the treatment of disease, and cured a great number of persons who had been regarded as incurable.  One day, he gave a consultation to a sick man, whose malady he described with entire exactness. ̶̶  "That is not enough," said a bystander, "You must now tell us the remedy."  ̶̶   " I cannot do so," he replied, "my angel-doctor is not here."  ̶  ̶   "What do you mean by your angel-doctor?"   "Why! the one who prescribes the remedies."  ̶̶ ̶   "Then it is not you who see the remedies?"  ̶̶  ̶  "No; did I not say that it is my angel-doctor who tells me what I am to prescribe?"

    Thus, in the case of this somnambulist, the seeing of the disease was the act of his own spirit, which, for that part of his work, had no need of assistance; but the remedies were dictated by another; so that, when this other was not present, the somnambulist could say nothing about them.  Left to himself, he was only a somnambulist; assisted by him who he called his 'angel-doctor,' he was a somnambulic medium.

The case of medical prescriptions is also a form of somnambulic mediumship used by Spiritist groups, though it is not one of the more common mediumistic practices, since the faculty is rare.   Obviously, though, much caution should be taken when consulting such a medium, and one should not do so without proper knowledge of the medium's mediumistic abilities and moral character, as well as the seriousness of the Center in which the medium works.  Finally, and again, though it is rare, somnambulist mediums can also work as unconscious speaking mediums (see "Speaking Mediums" on menu bar at left).
