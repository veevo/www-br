## WHAT IS A MEDIUM ?

In the dictionary medium is defined as:
> [1] An intervening substance through which something else is transmitted or carried on.  
> [2] An agency by which something is accomplished, conveyed, or transferred.  
> [3] A filtering substance, such as filter paper.  

In [Spiritism](/spiritism), a medium is defined as a person who is aware of and can communicate with the [spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world). This individual trough this other sense, is aware of a larger part of the universe than other individuals who do not have this sense developed.

The way in which this 6th sense expresses itself, and the nature of the communication that exists through this sense is widely varied.

Possession of this ability to become an intermediary between two dimensions (the physical and spiritual) just means that the ability has naturally developed to the point that the medium can become aware of the [phenomena](phenomena), and can develop the ability further. All the associations made between mediums and a high levels of ethical, intellectual evolution are mistaken. Mediumship is as with any other natural ability like music or poetry, it is in way a reflection of superiority.
