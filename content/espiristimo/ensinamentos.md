Being a [Science](../science), a [Philosophy](../philosophy) and a
[Religion](../religion) at the same time, Spiritism offers diverse and profound
teachings. We suggest the below list so new learners understand the most
essential teachings this lovely doctrine can offer.

## God
God is the supreme intelligence, the first cause of all the things. God is
eternal, infinite, unique, immaterial, all-powerful, sovereignly just and good.
He has to be infinite in all his perfections since, if we could suppose
imperfectness of even one of his attributes, he would not be God.

here](/about/god).

### God's Creations
God created matter which constitutes the worlds. He also created intelligent
beings called spirits which are in charge of these worlds according to the
creation’s [immutable laws](/divine-laws). Such laws are perfect by nature.  By
improving themselves the spirits approach God.

### God's Benevolence
Being sovereignly just and good, God does not punish his creatures to endless penalties as a 
consequence of their limited mistakes. He provides correction and evil repair for them at any moment. 

God forgives but also waits for regret, repair and return to good in such a way that punishment is 
proportional to the spirit’s insistence in the evil. Consequently penalties would be eternal only for 
those who forever remained on the evil side. As soon as a sigh of regret appears in the guilty heart, 
God holds out his mercy. 

Therefore, [eternal punishments](/about/eternal-punishment) should be understood in relative sense 
only and not in an absolute one since it's impossible for them to exist as every spirit will eventually
reach perfection.

## The intelligent principle of the Universe
Strictly speaking the spirit is the intelligent principle, its deepest nature is
unknown.  It is immaterial to us because it bears no resemblance to what we call
matter.

## Individuality of Spirits
The spirits are individual beings housed in a weightless and ethereal envelope called perispirit,
a kind of fluid body similar in form to the human’s body. They inhabit the space and fly 
quickly through it. The spirits constitute the invisible world.

## The origin of Spirits
The spirit’s origin and way of creation are unknown, we only known that they are
created simple and ignorant, that is, without knowledge of good and evil.
However they are equally capable to everything since God, in his justice, could
not free some from the work reserved for others in order to reach perfection. 

Initially they remain in a kind of infancy, without their own will and perfect
consciousness of their existence.

## Free Will
When ideas and [free-will](/divine-laws/free-will) are developed in the spirits,
the [superior spirits](/about/superior-spirit) intruct us that:

> ”You can reckon on supreme happiness provided that you acquire the lacking
> knowledge and fulfill the duties 
I impose upon you. You should work for your upgrading, that is your aim and you
will reach it by following the laws sculpted on you own consciences”. 

As consequence of their free-will some spirits take the shortest route which is
the good while others take the longest one which is the evil.

## Evil
God did not create the evil. He established the laws which are always good
because he is good

The spirits would have been completely happy had they faithfully observed the
law since the beginning. 

But, being free to make choices, the spirits have not properly obeyed them so
that evil come as a consequence of this unwillingness. One can then say that
good corresponds to everything which is in accordance with [God’s
law](/divine-laws) while evil is everything which opposes it.

### Material Body
In order to cooperate in the material worlds as agents of a divine power, the
spirits temporarily have a material body.  By the work required in their
corporeal lives, the spirits improve their intelligence and, by observing God’s
law, they acquire the merits which will lead them to [eternal
happiness](/about/eternal-happiness).

## Incarnations
The incarnation was not initially imposed on the spirits as a punishment. It is
rather necessary for the spirits’ improvement and for the fulfillment of God’s
works. Everyone has to submit to it, no matter if one takes the evil or the good
path. Only those who take the good path will improve quickly, they do not delay
to arrive at the end in less painful conditions.

## Humanity
Imbodied spirits constitute the humanity. It is not restricted to the earth only
but instead it inhabits all the worlds in space.

## Soul
Human soul is an imbodied spirit. In order to help humans, God has given them
the animals whose intelligence and character are according to their needs.

## Moral and Intellectual Development
The spirit’s improvement is a consequence of its own effort. It can not acquire
all the intellectual and moral qualities which will bring it to the end in only
one existence. It reaches its goal through a series of several lives. In each
one of them the spirit walks a little further in the path of progress.

## Corporeal Existences
In each corporeal existence the spirit has to fulfill a mission proportional to
its degree of development.  The rougher and harder it is, the greater the
spirit’s merit in fulfilling it. Each existence is, therefore, a test which
leads the spirit to the end. It depends on the spirit’s will to shorten it, by
working harder for its moral improvement, in much the same way a laborer’s will
shortens the number of his working days.

## Retrying falied corporeal existences
When an existence is poorly used, the spirit does not profit from it, and it has
to begin again a new life under more or less painful conditions, as consequence
of the spirit’s unwillingness and bad will.  In the same sense, in our life, we
may be obliged to do tomorrow what was left to do yesterday and do again what
was not well done.

## Spiritual and Corporeal Lifes
Spiritual life is the normal spirit’s life: it is eternal. Corporeal life is
transitory and it is just a moment in eternity.

## Intervals between lives
During the intervals of its lives, the spirit is [errant](/about/errant). This
state has no definite duration.  In it, the spirit is happy or sad according to
the good or bad use of its previous life. 

The spirit studies the causes which quickened or delayed its progress, and takes
proper decisions which it will try to put into practice in its next incarnation.
It also chooses the most adequate tests for its improvement.  Sometimes,
however, the spirit makes a mistake and falls, not fulfilling as a human being
the decisions it has taken as a spirit.

### Guilty Spirits
The guilty spirit is punished through moral sufferings in the [spirit
world](/about/spiritual-world) and physical penalties during its [corporeal
life](/about/corporeal-life). 

Its afflictions are consequence of its faults, that is, of its violation of
[God’s law](/divine-laws). These sorrows constitute both an atonement for the
past and a test for the future. 

In this way the proud can have a life of humiliations, the tyrant a servant life
and the wealthy oppressor an incarnation in misery.

## Different types of worlds
There are proper worlds to the several spirit’s advancement degrees, in which
life exists under different conditions. The less advanced the spirit is, the
weightier and more material is its body. 

In so far as the spirit purifies itself, it goes to morally and physically
superior worlds. 

The earth is not the first nor the last of these worlds but only one of the less
developed ones.

### Life in less advanced worlds
The guilty spirits are incarnated in less advanced worlds where they atone for
their faults through material life difficulties. These worlds constitute the
true purgatory. 

It depends on the spirit to get out of them working on its moral progress. 

The earth is a world of this kind.

## Incarnation
When spirits [incarnate](/about/incarnation) they bring together everything
acquired in their [past lives](/about/previous-lives). 

For these reason people instinctively exhibit special skills, good or bad
tendencies which seem innate.  Bad inborn inclinations represent the spirit’s
imperfection traces from which the spirit has not still liberated itself. 

They are also signs of past faults the spirit has committed. This is the true
sense of the original sin.  In each existence the spirit must wash itself out
from such impurities.

## The Law of Forgiveness
The human capacity to [forget previous lives](/divine-laws/forgiveness) reflects
God’s grace in so much as he, in his goodness, makes humans unaware of painful
memories. 

In each new life, the human being encounters exactly what he has made up for
himself, that is the state from which he has to depart. He knows his present
defects and knows that they are the result of his former lives. He comes to
conclusions regarding the evil he has committed and this is enough for him to
work and correct himself. 

If he no longer has these past imperfections, he does not need to consider them
any longer and his current mistakes are enough to worry about.

## The original sin
If the soul does not exist before birth then it is created together with the
body. Assuming this reasoning, the soul would have no relation with those which
came before it. 

How could then God, who is sovereignly just and good, blame it for the mistakes
of the human gender’ s father by blemishing it with an original sin the soul did
not commit ? 

One can give original sin a logical explanation everyone can understand if one
says that, through rebirth, the soul holds signs of its previous life
imperfections, that it suffers now exactly the result of its past mistakes, that
it is responsible for its acts.

## Moral and Intellectual aptitudes
The variety of moral and intellectual inborn aptitudes shows that the soul lived
already. 

The idea of the soul being created together with the body disagrees with God’s
goodness since God would then have made some souls more advanced than others.
Why does one then see wild and civilized, good and bad, intelligent and foolish
people ? 

Everything is otherwise easily explained if one supposes that some, by living
more than others, are therefore more advanced.

### The fate of children who die early
If the present life were the only one and if it were the soul’s only opportunity
to decide on its eternal destiny, what would then be the fate of children who
die very early ? 

If these children have done neither good nor bad, they should deserve neither
reward nor punishment. 

Following [Christ’s words](/gospel), if each one is rewarded according to his
works, these children have no right to an angel’s happiness and yet they should
not be refused a reward. 

On the contrary there are no exceptions if one admits they have several lives
and that they can do in a new existence what they could not in a past short one.

## The fate of cretins
By the same reasoning what would be the fate of cretins and idiots? 

As they are unaware of good and evil, they are not responsible for their acts.
Would God be just and good if he had created stupid souls and preordain them
with no rewards to a miserable life? 

On the contrary, if one says that the cretin or the idiot are souls tightly
bounded to unsuitable bodies which can not fully manifest their thoughts, then
everything is again according to God’s justice.

## The progression of the Spirit
In its successive incarnations the spirit little by little loses its impurities
and improves itself through work until the end of its corporeal lives. 

Then the spirit belongs to the pure spirit or angel order, and fully enjoy God’s
complete life and endless unshakable happiness.

## Earth Atonements
As good father, God does not leave people to themselves during their earth
atonements, but offers them instead their guides. These are firstly the
protecting spirits or guardian angels which watch over people and try to make
them follow the good way. 

Secondly there are the great incarnated spirits which sometimes appear on earth
in order to illuminate human paths and make humanity walk forward. Even if God
inscribed his law on human mind, he makes it even more explicit. Moses came
first, but his law spoke only about earthly life, its passing punishments and
rewards and were adapted to the people of his time. 

Then Christ came to complete Moses with a more elevated teaching: plurality of
lives, spiritual life and moral punishments and rewards. Moses led through fear
while Christ through love and charity.

## A new reign for humanity
The present and well understood Spiritism adds the evidence to the theory for
unbelievers, it demonstrates the future by obvious facts, it says in clear and
unmistakable terms what Christ said in parables. 

Spiritism explains unknown and misinterpreted truths, reveals the existence of
the invisible or spirit world and initiates people in the secrets of future
life. It also combats materialism which is a rebellion against God’s power. 

Finally Spiritism comes to establish the reign of humanity’s charity and
fraternity announced by Christ.  Moses plowed, Christ sowed and Spiritism has
came to harvest.

## The end of false interpretations
Spiritism is not a new light but a brighter one since it appeared in all parts
on the world through those who have lived. By making clear what was hidden,
Spiritism gives an end to false interpretations and will unite all humanity
under the same belief, since there is only one God whose laws are the same for
all. 

Finally Spiritism represents the time predicted by Christ and the prophets.

## The evils of society
The evils with which humans are afflicted on earth are caused by selfishness,
vanity and all bad passions.  People become unhappy and punish themselves by the
contact with their vices. 

Let charity and humbleness substitute selfishness and pride and they no longer
will injure themselves, they will respect each one rights and harmony and peace
will reign among them.

## Selfishness and Vanity
But how can selfishness and vanity be destroyed since these feelings seems so
innate to the human heart? 

Selfishness and vanity are in human heart because humans are spirits which have
been on the path of evil since the beginning and which, therefore, are exiled on
earth as punishment for their vices, their original sin to which many have not
renounced yet. Through Spiritism, God has came to make the last plea for the
practice of the lessons taught by Christ: the law of love and charity.

## The regeneration of Earth
Since the time for the earth to became home to peace and happiness has arrived,
God does not wish that bad spirits continue to disturb it at the sacrifice of
the good ones. 

Consequently bad spirits will have to leave earth: they will atone their
heartlessness on less developed worlds where they will work again on their
improvement during several, more painful and less happy lives than those on
earth.

These spirits will also constitute a newer and more enlightened race whose
duties will be to take progress to the less developed beings living on such
worlds. They will only go to a better world when they deserve it and will
continue there until they are completely refined. 

If the earth represents a purgatory to these spirits, these new worlds will be
their hell, but a hell with ever existing hope.

### A regenerated generation
While the outlawed generation will quickly disappear, a new one will arise whose
beliefs will be founded upon Christian Spiritism. 

We are witnessing an operating transition, a prelude to a moral renewal labeled
by Spiritism’s arrival.
