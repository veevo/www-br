On this post, let's explore the foundations of Spiritism.

## God
#### What is God?
[God](/about/god) is the Supreme Intelligence, first cause of all things.

#### Properties of God
God is eternal, immutable, immaterial, unique, omnipotent, supremely just and
good.  

#### God and the Universe
The Universe is God’s creation. It encompasses all rational and non-rational
beings, both animate and inanimate, material and immaterial.  

God created the universe, which comprehends all beings, animate and inanimate,
material and immaterial.  

## Universe and Worlds
#### Types of Worlds
Within the Universe there are other inhabited worlds, with beings at different
degrees of evolution: some equal, others more or less evolved than Human Beings.  

#### The Spiritual World
The spiritual world is the normal, original, eternal world; it is pre-existent
to and survives everything else.  

#### The Physical World
The physical world is secondary. It could cease to exist, or even have never
existed at all, and that would not affect the essence of the spirit-world.  

## Laws
All the Laws of Nature are [Divine Laws](/divine-laws) because [God](/about/god)
is their author.

The Divine Laws cover both the physical and moral laws.

## Human Beings
#### What is a human being
A Human Being is a Spirit incarnated in a material body. The perispirit is the
semi-material body that unites the Spirit to the physical body.  

#### Free will
Human Beings are given the [free will](/divine-laws/free-will) to act, but they
must answer for the consequences of their actions.  

#### Physical Beings
Physical beings constitute the visible or incarnate world; non-physical beings
constitute the invisible or spiritual world, i.e. the spirit-world.  

Among the different kinds of physical beings on Earth, God has chosen the human
species for the incarnation of spirits who have arrived at a certain degree of
development.  This characteristic gives the human species an ethical and
intellectual advantage over other living species.  

#### Body, Soul and Spirit
Human beings consist of the following:   
1) a body, similar to that belonging to animals and animated by the same [vital principle](/about/vital-principle);  
2) a [soul](/about/soul), an immaterial spirit incarnated in the body;   
3) the [perspirit](/about/perspirit), an intermediate link which unites the soul and body.  

#### Nature
Human beings have, accordingly, two natures: animal and spiritual.  Through the
body, humans participate in the nature of animals, with which they share
instincts.  Through the soul, they participate in the nature of the spirits.  

#### Qualities and Virtues
The qualities of a person are a reflection of the incarnate spirit's qualities.
Consequently, a good person is the incarnation of a good spirit, and a bad
person of a less advanced one.  

## Body and Soul
#### What is soul
The soul is an incarnate spirit, the body its material envelope.  

#### What happens when the body dies
On leaving the body, the soul returns to the spirit-world, where it exists as a
free spirit (i.e., free from the limitations of the physical world) and where it
will stay for an indeterminate time until it enters a new incarnation.  

#### Individuality of the soul
The soul possesses its individuality before incarnating and will preserve it
after the death of the body.  

#### The return to the spiritual world
On returning to the spirit world, the soul meets those it has known on Earth.

In addition, it gradually recalls the actions, both good and harmful, of its
former lives.  

## Spirits
In addition to the corporeal world inhabited by incarnate Spirits, which are Human Beings, there exists the spiritual world, inhabited by discarnate Spirits.  


#### What are spirits? 
The Spirits are the intelligent beings of creation. They constitute the world of the Spirits, which pre-exists and outlives everything.  


#### How spirits are created?
Spirits are created simple and ignorant. They evolve intellectually and morally,
passing from a lower order to a higher one, until they attain perfection, where
they will enjoy unalterable bliss.  

Spirits preserve their individuality before, during, and after each incarnation.  

#### How many reincarnations?
Spirits reincarnate as many times as is necessary for their spiritual advancement.  

#### Body
Spirits temporarily assume a perishable physical body, the death of which restores them to liberty.  

#### Progress
Spirits are always progressing. In their multiple physical existences, they may
sometimes become stationary but they never regress. The speed of their
intellectual and moral progress depends on the efforts they make to attain
perfection.  

#### Orders
Spirits belong to different orders according to the degree of perfection they
have attained: Pure Spirits, who have attained maximum perfection; Good Spirits,
whose predominant desire is towards goodness; and Imperfect Spirits,
characterized by their ignorance, their tendency towards evil, and by their
lower passions.  

Spirits belong to different orders; likewise they are not equals in power,
intelligence, knowledge, or ethical excellence.  Those in the highest order are
distinguished by purity, knowledge, and love of goodness.  They are the
so-called "angels" or "pure spirits."  The others are relatively more distant
from this perfection.  Those in the lower orders are inclined to most of our
human feelings and may still take pleasure in wrong-doing.  Among them are those
who are neither very good nor very bad, but have malicious, mischievous or
irksome natures.  These might be classed as giddy and foolish spirits.    

Spirits do not belong perpetually to the same order.  They are destined to
attain perfection and, as they do so, to progress up through the different
orders.  This advancement is achieved through incarnations, which are undertaken
either as special missions or as trials leading to purification.  Physical life
is an experience sprits must undergo many times before reaching this goal.
These lives can be understood as cleansing exercises from each of which spirits
generally emerge in a more purified state.    

#### Spiritual interference
The Spirits’ relations with Human Beings are constant and have always existed.
The Good Spirits attract us towards goodness, sustain us in life’s trials, and
help us bear them with courage and resignation. The Imperfect Spirits induce us
towards error.  

A spirit is not, therefore, an abstract being, a concept of thought. Rather, it
is a real and well-defined entity that, in certain situations, can be perceived
by sight, hearing, and touch.   

Spirits constantly exert an influence on both the physical and ethical
environment of the Earth.  They constitute one of the powers of nature, since
they may act equally upon matter and thought.  They are the cause of many sorts
of previously unexplained or misinterpreted phenomena, which may now find a
compelling rationale in the Spiritist Doctrine.  

Spirits constantly interrelate with human beings.  The good ones inspire people
to take the high road, sustain them through trials, and instill in them courage
and resignation.  On the other hand, the less advanced ones inculcate sordid
ideas and depressive thoughts.  They take pleasure in our troubles and strive to
make us like themselves.  

Spirit interactions with human beings can be either subtle or direct.  The
subtle communications happen without our awareness, generally in the form of
inspiration.  We need to exercise discernment, however, in distinguishing
between the uplifting and the malevolent kinds.  Direct exchanges occur through
writing, speech, and other physical manifestations, usually with the
intervention of a medium who acts as a link between the two worlds.  

#### Communication
Spirits may communicate spontaneously or in response to human evocations.
Generally speaking, all free intelligences may be evoked  ̶  from the most
obscure to the most illustrious, from loved ones to enemies ̶  regardless of the
epoch in which they lived.  If permitted, they may share information about their
new situation, their thoughts regarding us, and any insights they feel like
imparting.  

Spirits move by laws of affinity.  Advanced spirits take pleasure in assemblies
with a serious purpose, wherein members are animated by love and a sincere
desire to learn and progress.  Their presence repels less advanced spirits.  The
latter, in turn, find themselves at ease among frivolous and simple minds who
come together solely out of curiosity or other harmful motives.  In such
assemblies, nothing useful is produced.  To make matters worse, they often
borrow venerated names to impose their ideas more effectively.  

#### Teachings
It is easy to distinguish between advanced and less advanced spirits.   The
language of higher spirits is dignified, high-minded, and free from every trace
of human passion.  Their counsels breathe wisdom.  Their aim is always the
advancement of humanity.  On the other hand, remarks by less advanced spirits
make use of commonplace, sometimes coarse, language and often contain
substantial inconsistencies.  Although they sometimes make true and worthwhile
statements, their observations are usually ethically flawed and full of false
arguments.  They ply upon the naiveté of their audience by feeding false hopes
and swelling their listeners' egos.  Obviously, enlightening communications can
only be obtained in assemblies of a serious character where participants are
united in thought and desire by the pursuit of love and truth.  

The ethical teachings of the higher spirits may be summed up by the words of
Christ: "Do unto others as you would that others should do unto you."  In brief,
do good to all and wrong no one.  This principle of action furnishes humanity
with a rule of conduct with universal application, from the most trivial to the
most critical matters.  

Enlightened intelligences teach that self-centeredness, pride and sensuality
keep human beings engrossed in their animal nature. Accordingly, the person who
detaches him or herself from worldly things and who follows "love they neighbor"
grows more spiritual.  The spirits advise that we always serve others, as our
means allow us, and that the strong and powerful owe assistance and protection
to the weak.  They caution that the person who misuses power to oppress his or
her fellow beings violates the laws of God.  They also teach that in the
spirit-world nothing can be hidden; that the unavoidable presence of those we
have wronged on Earth is one of the trials we must face in the spirit world; and
that the ethical state of spirits, depending on how advanced or un-advanced they
are, gives rise, in that world, to enjoyments or to suffering and regrets.  

Further, they teach that there are no unpardonable faults and that there is no
misdeed that cannot be redressed.  Men and women find the means of redemption
and progress through reincarnation.  Their desire and efforts set the pace of
their advancement toward the ultimate aim of all perfection.  

## Jesus

#### Who is Jesus?
[Jesus](/about/jesus) is the Guide and Model for all Humankind.  

#### What is the Gospel?
The Doctrine He taught and exemplified is the most pure expression of God’s Law.  

The morality of Christ, as contained in the [Gospel](/gospel), is the pathway
for the secure progress of all Human Beings.  

#### Why practice His Gospel?
Its practice is the solution for all human problems and the objective to be
attained by Humankind.  

## Life
#### Future Life
[Future life](/about/future-life) reserves for Human Beings penalties and
pleasures according to the respect they do or do not show for [God’s
laws](/divine-laws).

## Prayer
#### What is Prayer?
Prayer is an act of adoration for [God](/about/god). It is found in the natural
law and is the result of an innate sentiment in every Human Being, just as the
idea of the existence of the Creator is innate.

#### Why Pray?
Prayer makes Human Beings better. Whoever prays with fervor and confidence grows
stronger against evil temptations, and God sends the [Good
Spirits](/about/superior-spirit) to assist them.  This type of assistance will
never be denied when requested with sincerity.

## Incarnations
#### What's an incarnation?
Spirits have many incarnations. From this we can conclude that we all have had
many existences and will have many others on Earth and elsewhere.  

#### How does it happen?
The incarnation of spirits only takes place in human beings.  Spirits do not
incarnate in animal form.  

The chain of incarnations is always progressive.  
The spirit's speed of progress depends on its efforts, but it cannot regress.   

#### Material Influence
An incarnate spirit is under the influence of matter. Essentially, after an
incarnation 2 things can happen to the incarnate spirit

* 1 - Those who surmount this influence, through self-purification, raise themselves nearer to the higher spheres.  

* 2 - Those who give in to instinctual tendencies and pursue solely the gratification of physical desires are closer to the inferior realm.  

#### Where do spirits incarnate?
Incarnated spirits live on different worlds throughout the universe.   

#### Non-incarnating spirits
Free (or not incarnated) spirits do not occupy a circumscribed space.  
They are found everywhere, and they both perceive and regularly associate with human beings.  
They constitute an invisible but active society that constantly interacts with our own.
