Many centers offer meetings or study groups for the youth, as well, with lessons
that are appropriate for their age group and with topics presented in such a way
as to help them deal with what goes on in their daily lives.  

## Fluidic Therapy
In the end (and during) the studies, everyone (including children), is invited
to also participate in the fluidic therapy.
