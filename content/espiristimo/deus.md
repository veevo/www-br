In the first question of [The Spirits’ Book](/books/allan-kardec/spirits-book),
[Allan Kardec](/profiles/allan-kardec) asks the [superior
spirits](/about/superior-spirits), “What is God?” The answer given is that “God
is the Supreme Intelligence, the First Cause of all things.”  He then proceeds
to ask, “What are the proofs of God’s existence?”, to which the superior spirits
answer:
> “An axiom in science states that there is no effect without a cause.  Look for
> the cause of things which are not the work of human beings, and your reason
> will provide the answer.”

In the opening to his chapter on the “Profession of a Rationalized, Spiritist
Faith”, in the book [Posthumous Works](/books/allan-kardec/posthomous-works),
Kardec repeats the Spirits’ definition of God, as stated above, and the axiom to
which they made reference, adding the following comments. 

> "We constantly see an immensity of effects, whose cause is not in Humanity,
> since Humanity is incapable of producing them. The cause is above Humanity. It
> is that cause we call God, Jehovah, Allah, Brahma, Fo-hi, Great Spirit, etc.
> Such effects are absolutely not produced by chance, by accident, or without
> order. From the organization of the smallest insect and the most insignificant
> seed, to the laws that govern the worlds that circulate through Space,
> everything gives proof of one guiding idea, a scheme, a foresight, a
> thoroughness in care, all of which surpass any human creations."

## Attributes of God
Following the answer to question 13, Kardec adds the following discussion,
explaining the reasoning behind the qualities listed as part of that question.

* God is infinite and eternal.  If we assume a being to God’s existence, we must
  mean that God either sprang from nothing or was created by some other being.
  Our realization that this is not true leads us to our ideas of Infinity and
  Eternity.
* God is unchangeable.  If this were otherwise, universal laws would have no
  stability.
* God is immaterial and by nature differs from everything we call matter.
  Without this quality, God would not be unchangeable and would be subject to
  the transformations of matter.
* God is unique.  If there were more than one God, there would be neither unity
  of plan nor unity of power in the ordering of the universe.
* God is all-powerful.  The possession of anything less than sovereign power
  would indicate the existence of something more powerful than or just as
  powerful as God.  Without sovereign power, God would not have created all
  things, and those things that have not been created by one God would be the
  work of another God.
* God is sovereignly just and good. The wisdom of the divine laws is revealed as
  clearly in the smallest things as in the greatest.  This wisdom makes it
  impossible to doubt either God’s justice or goodness.  

## Our Instinctive Belief
The instinctive belief in a supreme force, a higher creator or governing
power(s) has been with humanity throughout all of time. It can be witnessed in
even the most primitive of cultures, which demonstrates, as the superior spirits
tell Kardec, that such a belief can not be the result of education or the
assimilation of cultural ideas.  Though the details regarding a specific nature
have been described with great differences across various belief systems, the
fact that such an instinctive notion has been found universally, among all
groups and generations of people, is evidence of its basis in reality.

This instinctive belief is an extension, almost an unconscious recognition, of
the axiom that there is no effect without a cause.  Having developed (through
the evolution of humanity) our abilities to analyze and reason, we can find
proof of God’s existence in the rational extension of that axiom as well.  It is
here that we extend the very reasoning of that axiom to deduce that every
intelligent effect must have an intelligent cause.   To recognize such
intelligent effects, we need only to look around and observe the natural
environment in which we live and are a part of.  In observing the physical
complexity and perfection of all living and non-living things that make up our
natural world, we appreciate how each piece has its purpose and fits
harmoniously into the bigger puzzle.  When we recognize the harmonious and
consistent workings of the laws of nature, our logic will tell us that all of
this must be caused by an intelligent power, greater than all else. 

A simple example of the above reasoning is found in the story dictated by the
Spirit Meimei (through the medium, Francisco Candido Xavier) in “Ideas and
Illustrations”,  in which an old, illiterate Arab was asked by his rich master
why he prayed every night with so much faith, and how he knew that God existed.
The old man explained that just as one recognizes the origin of a letter by the
handwriting on the envelope, the origin of a jewel by the mark of the jeweler,
or whether a camel or a dog has passed by from the tracks left on the ground,
one can know the existence of God by his signs.   He pointed to the sky, where
the moon shone, surrounded by a multitude of brilliant stars and explained that
such stars could not be the work of men who could never have put them there,
whereas they must be the work of God, and that that was how he knew that God
existed.

During earlier times, among primitive cultures, the instinctive belief in God
stemmed greatly from an inability to explain the workings of nature, whereby all
that was inexplicable was attributed to a higher power or powers, greatly
respected and often feared.  However, over time, man has discovered a great deal
about his environment and has discovered many natural laws.  We have even
learned how to reproduce many of the effects we find in nature.  The result of
such discoveries is that they have lead many scientists to believe that in
matter itself, they will find all the keys to unlocking, and in many cases
reproducing, the secrets of the universe, which they believe will eventually be
explicable without the inclusion of any spiritual or divine aspect.  However,
turning again to our rational deductions, as mentioned above, we will recognize
that even the greatest discoveries of modern science will all be the discoveries
of effects, and not of the first cause, whereby such discoveries should only
lead us to a greater admiration of the Intelligence of that first cause.  


## Nature of God
Just as it would be impossible to explain light to a man who was born blind, or
to explain chemistry to an infant, we humans are not yet able to understand the
true, complete nature of our creator.  Our spirits have not yet acquired the
proper level of intellectual and moral advancement.  However, we are able to
rationalize some of the qualities of perfection attributed to this supreme
being.

Allan Kardec, in the Spirit’s Book intelligently inquired about our creator,
asking not “Who is God”, but rather “What is God”.  The question of “Who” would
imply inquiries as to God’s origin, age, and intimate nature.  “What” however
defines God’s activity, condition, and qualifications, which are more in tune
with what we are able to comprehend, and what we are able to express in terms of
the extent of our current languages.

In answer to the first question of  “The Spirits’ Book”, the spirits replied
that we should understand God as the “Supreme Intelligence, the First Cause of
all things."  Questions 10-13 of this book are related to inquiries pertaining
to God’s attributes, those characteristics that we are able to understand at
present.  Below are the referenced questions and the answers given by the
superior spirits.

Q 10. "Can any individual understand the essential nature of God?" "No, human
beings lack the capability for such understanding."

Q 11. "Will we ever be able to comprehend the mystery of God?" "When human
beings have advanced sufficiently - that is, when they have overcome the yoke of
matter - they will be more capable of comprehending God."

Kardec's additional comments to this answer: "The limited nature of our human
faculties prevents us from having a complete understanding of God’s nature.  As
a result, in the early stages of human development, we often confused the
Creator with the creation and attributed to the former the qualities of the
latter.  However, as we progress spiritually, we will be able to penetrate the
nature of things, more deeply and form a more just and rational idea of God,
though our ideas will always be incomplete."

Q 12. "If we cannot understand the essential nature of God, can we at least have
some idea of God's perfections?" "Yes, some of them. You will understand them
better as you raise yourself above matter and master your own minds."

Q 13. "When we say that God is eternal, infinite, unchangeable, immaterial,
unique, all-powerful, sovereignly just and good, aren't we expressing a complete
idea of the qualities of the Divine?" "Yes, from your point of view. But don't
think that you sum up everything in these terms. You must understand that there
are things that transcend the capacity of even the most intelligent person and
that outstrip the power of language to express. However, your reason tells you
correctly that God must possess the perfections you mention in the supreme
degree. Lacking one of them or having less than the absolute degree in any of
them, God would be less than perfect; and in order to be above all things, to be
almighty, God must have no imperfections."
