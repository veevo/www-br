## Introduction
All around us are spirits of varying levels of evolution and of moral and intellectual development, who regularly influence us through their suggestions and intuitions, be they positive or negative, depending on the nature of the spirit. This is because the material world in which we live operates in a continuous interaction with the spiritual realm that coexists alongside side it.  The beings of both worlds are able to influence and affect one another.

Spirits are able to influence one another by way of thought, first, in the role of thought as the mechanism behind spirit communication, and second, because the innermost (even subconscious) thoughts of any spirit determine the nature and quality of its own vibrations, or energies, which ultimately affect those around the spirit and, likewise, attract others of similar character, ideas, emotions, etc. This influence can be positive or negative, depending on the nature of the spirit who is exercising the influence, and when a negative influence becomes persistent and directed, it takes on the form of what is referred to by Spiritists, as obsession.
