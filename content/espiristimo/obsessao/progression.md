## Progression

An obsession can be found in varying degrees of advancement, thereby presenting characteristics that also vary in nature and severity. The "lightest" degree of influence is called a simple obsession, in which the spirit begins to persuade the thoughts and ideas of his subject, through repetitive suggestions that the individual eventually captures and, most often, confuses as his own. Likewise, through the effect of these altered thoughts and/or through the transfer of fluids, or energies, that the obsessing spirit impresses upon his subject, via the involvement of his own perispirit with that of the subject, the obsessed individual will experience alterations in his emotional state and/or an aggravation of an already unhealthy, emotional imbalance.

If the obsessed person does not recognize and take effective action to change his unhealthy thought patterns and any resulting behaviors, the door that he has opened to the spirit who targets him will only widen, whereby he will further concede to the increasing mental constriction and fluidic involvement exercised by the spirit.  An additional consequence is that the spiritual imbalance and emotional disturbance can reflect in the physical condition of the individual, resulting in some kind of physical illness or disturbance.  With time, and barring action taken to stop it, the obsession will naturally progress, allowing the obsessing spirit, at each step, a greater degree of control. Eventually, the process can reach the more severe stages of subjugation, sometimes referred to as possession, which involves a constriction of great intensity that blocks the will of the victim, who then acts in accordance with the will of his oppressor. This progression can culminate in an absolute dependence of the victim on the spirit(s) who subjugate(s) him, and in which the obsessor dominates even the physical body of his subject, without the incarnate spirit of the latter ever completely leaving the body, as this complete separation only occurs with death.
