### Introduction 
The Codification of Spiritism is the collection of principles and laws, 
revealed by the [Superior Spirits](/about/superior-spirit)
to [Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec). The spiritual mentor and guide for 
all the work was [The Spirit of Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth),
[Jesus](/about/jesus) himself.

The main 5 books are:
[The Spirits' Book](/books/spirits-book), [The Mediums' Book](/books/mediums-book), 
[The Gospel According to Spiritism](/books/gospel-according-spiritism),
[Heaven and Hell](/books/heaven-and-hell), and 
[Genesis](/books/genesis).

### History
If you're interested, we provide in detail how these books were organized
[on this page](../origins).

### The first published book
When Rivail submitted this idea to the communicators they replied:-

> ‘To the book…you will give, as being our work rather than yours,
the title of Le Livre des Espirits (The Spirits’ Book); and you will publish it, not under your own name,
but under the pseudonym of Allan Kardec [‘Kardec’ was an old Breton name in his mother’s family].
Keep your own name of Rivail for your own books already published.’

### How to read the books
All these books contain very profound and life-changing knowledge. In order to maximize your understanding,
we recommend you to find a nice and quite place to read, far from distractions and interruptions and 
start with [The Spirits Book](/books/allan-kardec/spirits-book), reading 2, 3 questions at a time
and reflecting carefully on their answers.

Then, we suggest read the beautiful [Gospel According to Spiritism](/books/allan-kardec/gospel-according-spiritism)
which contains the Spiritist vision of [the Gospel](/gospel) along with multiple comments
by Kardec himself, from [Superior Spirits](/about/superior-spirit) and from 
[The Spirit of Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth), [Jesus](/about/jesus) himself.
