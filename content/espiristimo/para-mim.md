Spiritism does not prescribe any religion, nor does it discriminate against the
followers of any religion. Likewise, it does not impose its own beliefs on
anyone. It simply reveals truths about the material and spiritual worlds, at the
same time fulfilling the moral and spiritual needs of man in a practical and
rational manner, and it will be found and followed by those who are seeking its
knowledge. 

### Follow your heart
Responding to the suggestion that Spiritism was not a new religion, people often
asked Kardec if they needed to follow one of the traditional religions, and if
so, which one was best.  He encouraged them to follow their heart.

If you're looking for what's best for you, keep these words from Kardec in mind: 

The best of all religions is that which:  
* teaches only what is in accordance with the goodness and justice of God;   
* presents the greatest and most sublime idea of God and does not debase Him by attributing to Him the weaknesses and passions of humanity;    
* helps men to be good and virtuous and teaches them to love one another like brothers;    
* condemns every evil done to a neighbor; does not condone injustice under any pretext;    
* teaches nothing contrary to the unchangeable laws of nature  
* is led by ministers who set the best example of goodness, charity and morality;    
* combats best and flatters least the pride and vanity of men; and finally,    
* one in whose name the least evil is committed.<br><br>

## A good religion
Kardec, on the book Christian Spiritism, p 106 tells us this:

> A good religion cannot serve as justification to any evil whatsoever; it must
> not leave any door open to evil either directly or through interpretation.
> Look, judge, and choose!" <br><br>
