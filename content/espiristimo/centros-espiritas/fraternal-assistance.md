## About Fraternal Assistance

Fraternal assistance is a friendly counseling service offered to those who come to the Spiritist center looking for advice or help with a particular personal issue. The counselor will sit with the individual seeking help, listening to his or her problem and helping the individual to analyze the situation from Spiritist viewpoint.
