## What are Spiritist Centers

You may wonder where those who follow Spiritism go to meet, study, work, and pray together.

Spiritists do not have what is commonly referred to as a church, temple, shrine, etc.  In fact, Spiritism is not actually a religion per se, i.e. in the traditional sense, since there exists no hierarchical structure of authority or dogmatic practices. The place where Spiritists gather is referred to as a Spiritist Center. There, they collaborate, with one another and with spiritual benefactors, in the study, practice, and dissemination of Spiritism. 

### Organization
Spiritist Centers operate independently, though some are affiliated with larger associations or federations that bring various Centers together for events and special initiatives related to the dissemination of Spiritism.  The Centers are often (though not always) named after a historical pioneer of Spiritism, a mentoring Spirit, or sometimes a charitable quality, etc. Ì¶  for example, Allan Kardec Spiritist Center, Andre Luiz Spiritist Center, Love and Fraternity Spiritist Center, etc.

### Structure
Centers are often run by a board of directors, but these are elected positions. Such positions, as well as those involving the other work that goes on in managing the Center and organizing and running its activities are non-paid positions. The people who work in a Spiritist center and fulfill those roles do so as volunteers.

### Typical Activities at a Spiritist Center
A Spiritist center is more than just a place to study. It is a place to pray, learn, grow, collaborate, and work for the  benefit of others.  It is often said that a Spiritist center is a home, a school, and a hospital, all in one.

Spiritist centers cover an extremely broad spectrum in terms of size, number, and scope of activities.  There are some centers with as few as 10 or 20 people, others with hundreds, and even, in some cases, thousands of members.  Still, there are some basic activities common to most centers, regardless of size.
