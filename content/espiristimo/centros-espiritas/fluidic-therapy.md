## About Fluidic Therapy

This practice of magnetization involves the transmission, or donation of positive, restorative energies/fluids that help to revitalize and re-balance those of the patient. Normally, it refers to the utilization of a technique involving “hand passes” as well as magnetized water.   At the Spiritist center, you may also hear this referred to  as "passes", “spiritual healing” or “bioenergetic therapy”. 

You can read more about Fluidic Therapy by reading the section titled "Intro to Fluidic Therapy", found in the web section for the scientific aspect of Spiritism.
