## Backlash to the Codification

Even though the Spiritist Codification made Rivail a house hold name in much of the continent, the UK and later in America and Brazil, for him personally putting the revelations of the Spirit Teachers to paper cost him dearly. The Spirit teachers had told Rivail that he would find harsh criticism and resistance among the Church, among other intellectuals and even among the growing Spiritist organizations that were forming as a result of the Codification. Even physically Rivail would pay a hard price for taking on this immense task. Unfortunately that was exactly how things progressed.

Before the publication of The Spirits’ Book in 1856, the Holy Office, under Pope Pius IX, had prohibited mediumship and ‘other analogous superstitions’ as ‘heretical, scandalous, and contrary to the honesty of customs’. But in 1861 the Bishop of Barcelona took more direct action. He ordered an auto-da-fe (act of the faith) known as the Edict of Barcelona, against three-hundred Spiritist books, including many by Rivail, that were confiscated and burnt in public.40 However, the Bishop’s actions did nothing more than stir up French nationalism and contribute to the further growth of Spiritism in both France and Spain. Hess adds that when the Bishop died nine months afterwards, his repentant spirit manifested through several French mediums begging for Rivail’s forgiveness which was, apparently, granted. In France, the dean of the Faculty of Theology of Lyons began public education courses against Spiritism and Mesmerism in 1864 and Spiritism was widely branded as a form of demon worship in writings by clergymen.

Rivail accused the Church of deliberately inciting hatred against Spiritists:- ‘From the pulpit, we Spiritists have been called enemies of society and public order…In some places, Spiritists were censured to the point of being persecuted and injured on the streets, while the faithful were forbidden to hire Spiritists and were warned to avoid them as they would avoid the plague. Women were advised to separate from their husbands…Charity has been refused to the needy and workers have lost their livelihoods, just because they were Spiritists. Blind men have even been discharged, against their will, from some hospitals because they would not renounce their beliefs.’41

As with Spiritualism in America and Britain, certain sections of the French scientific establishment also reacted with hostility to the spread of Spiritism. Hess mentions that a Dr Dechambre, a member of the Academy of Medicine, published a critique of the movement in 1859, and also cites reports of insanity, allegedly caused by Spiritism, that had started to circulate by 1863.42 There was even a French equivalent to the theory, which originated in America, that spirit raps were produced by the cracking of the knee and toe joints. The French variation on this theme was presented to the Academy of Medicine by a surgeon, M. Jobert, who attributed the noises to skilful cracking of the short tendon of the muscle of the instep.43

Kardec spent the remainder of his life defending Spiritism from attacks from every direction. In spite of having developed a heart condition, Rivail never stopped his tireless works in the study, teaching and spreading of Spiritism. Inevitably in March 31st, 1869 he succumb to an aneurysm, dieing instantly in the small Spiritist bookstore he ran out of his home.
