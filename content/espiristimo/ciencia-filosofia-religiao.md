## Spiritsm: SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY or RELIGION?
We are at the dawn of the Third Millennium and there are many persons who have as yet not come to know or understand [Jesus](/profile/jesus). At a time in which so much scientific knowledge is available, our hearts still thirst. Let's review what Spiritism and its triple aspect of Science, Philosophy and Religion means on the third millennium.

Let us get a little deeper into this theme: It was that same Master, who had promised to send us the [Consoler](/about/consoler), to teach mankind all things and to call to mind all that he had said. [Spiritism](/spiritism) has come at the predicted time to fulfill Christ’s promise. Through its triple aspect, Science, Philosophy and Religion, it has come to satiate us and to show us the way to Light, Tolerance and Love.

[Allan Kardec](/profiles/allan-kardec) worked a lot for the purity of the [doctrine](/spiritism). It was born out of intensive and persistent work; years of observation, scrutinization and confirmation. It was not dictated empirically. Without a doubt it was meticulously organized by a great man. You can just imagine Kardec sitting at his usual table being oriented by [the Spirit of Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth) and His Phalange, of constant workers receiving this information, yet formulating intensive questions for clarification and accuracy.

## Science
Let us analyze then its three aspects. In its first aspect, [Science](/science), Spiritism gives us as basis: the knowledge of the [invisible world](/about/spiritual-world), in the center of which we live. It exposes [the laws](/divine-laws) that govern the invisible world and its relationships with the corporeal world. It reveals the nature and the study of the beings that inhabit it, and the human beings” destiny after and beyond death.

Science and [Spiritism](/spiritism) complement one another. Science without Spiritism is unable to explain certain specific [phenomena](phenomena/). The same applies to Spiritism. It would not have had credibility without the confirmation by Science.

## Philosophy
Its second aspect, [Philosophy](/philosophy), focuses on the moral consequences that occur between the relationships of the [spiritual world](/spiritual-world) with the [physical world](/material-world). It studies the [communications](/spiritism/mediumship/communications) with the spiritual world, deducing with logic and reasoning the foundations of Science and of Religion, as follow:
* The existence of [God](/about/god);
* The constant and infinite progress of the intelligent principle, through the world and through appropriate bodies.

Spiritism is a Philosophical Doctrine, but it has religious consequences, as does every spiritual philosophy, because it touches unavoidably on the basis of all religions: God, the soul and the future life.Finally we have the Religious aspect.

## Religion
Spiritism is not a constituted religion. It has no cult, no rites, no temples and among its followers none is designated as head in charge or priest. However, it will institute the true religion, a natural religion that thrives from the heart and reaches [God](/about/god) directly, because its faith is reason and its morals, Christian.

As a Science, Spiritism is allied to Religion. As Philosophy, it has religious consequences. As Religion (without contradicting the Laws of Nature) it does not stand in the way of progress and will be invulnerable.

## Conclusion
The Spiritist Doctrine, we admit, is relatively new, as it is only 152 years old, but as we visualize, what it embraces, it can always be considered actual. Let us not forget that it was brought to us by a Phalange of Spirits presided over by Jesus, and in the same manner that the Master's teachings, have remained with us for 2000 years, the Spiritist Doctrine will continue to shine throughout eternity, because it represents the purest truth, on the path that lead us to the Father.
