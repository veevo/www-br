Spiritist Centers offer public classes open to everyone as well as study groups.

Spiritist centers offer weekly classes or study groups. The duration of
such studies can be anywhere from a few weeks to a few years.  The studies are
centered around a particular book or theme.  Likewise, many centers also offer a
class that teaches the basic principles of Spiritism to newcomers.
