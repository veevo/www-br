Many Spiritist centers offer a study time for children to attend while their
parents are attending a public meeting. In this way, the center helps the
parents to expose children to the basic precepts and teachings of Spiritism, in
a manner that is accessible to them. They're given the seeds of a knowledge that
will help them to interact in a positive way with the world around them.

## Fluidic Therapy
In the end (and during) the studies, everyone (including children), is invited
to also participate in the fluidic therapy.
