Spiritism differs from all known religions by demonstrating the logic of its
teachings through scientific studies and experiments and by presenting a
[philosophy](../philosophy) that is also based on experimentation and
observation, as documented by a multitude of intellectuals of universal renown.

A scientific and philosophic religion of teachings that are basic to all
religions, Spiritism does not intend to demolish those faiths which came before
it, and instead recognizes their necessity for a great part of Humanity, as
humanity's evolution takes place slowly yet inevitably.
	     	
A religious doctrine without so-called dogmas, rituals, symbols, or an organized
priesthood, and to the contrary of almost all other religions.

## Practices that don't belong in Spiritism
There is a lot of misconception and misunderstanding about what [Spiritism](../)
is and around which practices and/or activities that happen on a [Spiritist
Center](../centers).

For that reason, we want to highlight that Spiritism does not adopt any of the
following as port of its meetings or practices below:

* special adornments, vestments or other clothing; 
* wine or any alcoholic beverages; 
* incense, myrrh, smoke or other substances that produce smoke; 
* alters, images, andors, candles, or any other material objects that would aid
  in the attraction of the public; 
* hyms or songs in exotic or antiquated languages  (hyms and songs, when used,
  are in the language of the country, and are used exclusively for festivities
  held for children and youth and in special sessions, when required, for
  certain physical effects); 
* dances, processions, and other similar acts; 
* activities and practices that answer to material or dissolute interests; 
* payment for any type of favor o assistance given to another; 
* talismans [inscribed charms], amulets [good luck objects/charms], miraculous
  prayers, scapulars, or any other similar objects or things; 
* administering of sacraments; concession of indulgences, assigning of noble
  titles; 
* horoscope reading, card reading, fortune-telling, astrology and kinds of
  predictions 
* extravagant rituals or stagings designed to impress the public; 
* exotic or strange terms for the designation of beings and things; 
* promises or acts of witchcraft, the making of the sign of the cross, in other
  words, a long series of material acts dating back to old and primitive
  religious concepts.

## Spiritual Phenomena
Psychic (or spiritual) phenomena can arise in any religious or non-religious
environment, and its appearance can lead one think that that's Spiritism.

However it's important to note that the consolidation of the belief, the
knowledge of the laws that govern the universe and help developing virtues and
morals of men, and the perfect assimilation of the Spiritist Doctrine can only
be reached through the study of the works of [Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec)
and those who have followed him.
