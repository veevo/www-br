Trough philosophical thought and exploration, man seeks to answer the great
questions of life:  Who are we?  Where do we come from?  What is our Purpose?
Where are we going?  Spiritism addresses all those questions in its rational and
uplifting philosophy, a philosophy grounded in scientific study and logical
thought

Spiritist philosophy not only satisfies our insatiable desire for the answers to
these questions, but also arms us with wisdom for defense against life's
struggles and with a moral framework for the achievement of progress and the
attainment of true happiness. 

Spiritism focuses on studying our [moral behaviour](/about/moral) the [moral
laws](/about/moral-laws) and the outcomes of each our our acts in our lifes and
thus on the Universe.

Spiritists also practice profound, [reflexive studies](/about/reflexive-study)
of [The Gospel of Jesus](/gospel), the [Spiritist Codification](/spiritism) and
from instructions and readings provided by the [Superior
Spirits](/about/superior-spirits).

[Allan Kardec](/bio/allan-kardec) who codified the Spiritist Doctrine asked
profound phylosophycal questions to the [mentors of
humankind](/about/superior-spirits), all documented on the [The Spirits'
Book](/books/spirits-book).

That book also provides us valuable information regarding the relationship
between the [spiritual world](/about/spiritual-world) and the [physical
world](/about/material-world).  

How [communication](/spiritism/mediumship/communication) between
[incarnated](/about/incarnated) and [discarnated](/about/discarnate) beings
happen, proofs of the existence of [God](/about/god), information about the
constant and infinite progress of the intelligent principle, through the world
throughout multiple bodies.

Spiritism is a Philosophical Doctrine, but it has religious consequences, as
does every spiritual philosophy, because it touches unavoidably on the basis of
all religions: God, the soul and the future life.
