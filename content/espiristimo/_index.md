Welcome to our special section about Spiritism! On this section we hope to teach
you a little more about what Spiritism is, its foundations, contributions and
how it can help you being a better, happier person.

## Starting with Spiritism 
Want to start right away? Read our [introduction to Spiritism](about), the
[FAQ](faq) or jump right into the [Spiritist Codification](codification), the
essance of the teachings of Spiritism.

## Why Spiritism?
Maybe you're asking yourself, why Spiritism?

Spiritism is probably the best tool available to _[help you know
thyself](/about/know-thyself)_.  That very (if not the most important)
commitment [we chose to realize in this
incarnation](/spiritism/reincarnation/planning) is the key to understanding [why
we suffer](/articles/why-we-suffer), understanding more about our
[lives](/about/life), [death](/about/death), [virtues](/virtues),
[moral](/about/moral), our [vices](/vices) and more, much more.

## How to reach out to Spiritists?
Looking to meet other Spiritists? Spiritists usually gather on [Spiritist
Centers](/spiritism/centers): places dedicated for studying, practicing and
collecting the spiritual blessings provided in the house.  On [this
section](centers) you'll also learn about [Spiritist Councils](/councils),
bodies that orient, guide and foster the Spiritist doctrine around the world.
