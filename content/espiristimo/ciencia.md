## Introduction
Have you ever asked yourself some of these questions before:  
* Is Earth the only inhabited planet in the Unverse?  
* Do ghosts exist? What about aliens?  
* Was Atlantida real?  
* How can't science still not explain mysteries in Egypt and other ancient civilizations?  

In order to respond those and other questions, let us introduce [the basic
elements of the universe](basic-elements).

## Alliance between Science and Religion
> "Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind."  -
> Albert Einstein

Humanity has reached a point in evolution where any significant, moral progress
will necessitate a true alliance between the theories of  science and religion,
yet we continue to struggle with many disparities between them.  As Kardec
explains, the revelations of Spiritism will be the key to closing the gap
between these two "levelers of human intelligence."

Below is an excerpt from "The Gospel According to Spiritism"ยน, in which Kardec
addresses the topic of this "alliance between science and religion." 

* Science and religion are the two levelers of human intelligence. One reveals
  the laws of the material world, the other the laws of the spiritual one. Now,
  since these laws stem from the same first cause, which is God, they can't
  contradict each other. If they did, it stands to reason that one would have to
  be right and the other wrong, which would be inconsistent with the divine
  design. Consequently, the apparent incompatibility that exists between science
  and religion is simply the result of incomplete views of the world and
  one-sided positions taken by both parties. This conflict of ideas has often
  given rise both to unbelief and intolerance. <br><br>
* The time has come, however, when the teachings of Christ can be interpreted in
  their fullest significance. The veil of allegory that he purposely used on
  many occasions must be lifted. Science must see beyond matter and acknowledge
  a spiritual perspective; religion must stop ignoring the fundamental laws of
  matter. Only in this way will both sides come together and learn to lean on
  each other. As a result, religion will no longer be discredited by science.
  Its accordance with reason and with the compelling logic of the events of
  nature will give religion a new, unshakable power.   <br><br>
* Until our own day, science and religion have struggled with their differences.
  Each has had a tendency to see matters only according to its own particular
  point of view, and each has rejected the other. Clearly, something more was
  needed- something that would allow these two realms of knowledge to close the
  gap between them. The missing link is contained in the knowledge of the laws
  that govern the non-physical (spiritual) realm and its interactions with the
  world of matter- laws, it should be pointed out, as constant as the ones that
  govern the movement of the stars and the existence of living beings. Once
  these interactions are empirically demonstrated, we will see things in a new
  light. Faith will speak to reason; reason will find nothing illogical in
  faith; materialism will be overcome.   <br><br>
* Nevertheless, in this case as in many others, there will always be those who
  initially choose to stay behind. They might, for a while, resist the new
  views, but they too will eventually be overtaken by this new wave of progress.
  A new moral revolution is taking place whose foundation has been maturing for
  over eighteen centuries. Directed by the higher intelligence of the spirit
  world, this silent revolution, which will bring about a new era for the human
  race, now nears the completion. Its consequences are easy to predict; the new
  order will produce inevitable changes in all aspects of social relations. We
  say inevitable because no one will be able to circumvent these changes; they
  are part of the designs of Providence, a natural by-product of the Divine Law
  of Progress.

In the book [Genesis](/books/allan-kardec/genesis), [Allan
Kardec](/profiles/allan-kardec), the author and responsible for this research,
explains on Chapter 14:

* The cosmic fluid is the fundamental constituent of all matter. 
* The cosmic fluid assumes **two extreme states**, with a gradient of variations
  between the two. One state is **materialization**, which leads to the
  phenomena of the visible/material world. The other is **etherealization**
  which produces the phenomena of the invisible world. 
* All modifications of the fluid, whether perceptible to us or not, are
  considered matter and can be found in an infinite range of degrees of purity
  tangible to us or not.  
* Some modifications of the fluid are known as spiritual fluids and form the
  matter of the spiritual world. Many of these spiritual fluids escape the
  perception of our human senses and instruments. Other variations are
  intimately tied to the corporeal life.
* The fluids that are closest to the materialization are the least pure. They
  make up the the spiritual atmosphere of the Earth and are in constant
  interaction with the material realm, whereby they affect, and are affected by,
  the beings that inhabit it.
