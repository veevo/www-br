Spiritist centers often organize different activities, sometimes as one-time
events and other times on a regular schedule, that offer social assistance to
their community. 

A few examples may be: 
* the collection and donation of food, clothing, etc; 
* the provision of free medical assistance to the poor, offered by doctors volunteering their time;
* friendly visits at hospitals, nursing homes and orphanages; 
* educational campaigns; 
* and other activities in which members can volunteer their time and abilities to help those less fortunate than themselves.
