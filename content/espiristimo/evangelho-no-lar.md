The Gospel At Home is a special time set aside each week for family or
household members to gather at home and jointly elevate their thoughts in prayer
and study. As the name suggests, the focus of study is on the collection of
moral lessons, comforting passages, and encouraging words, inspired by the
teachings and examples left by our model and guide, [Jesus](/about/jesus).

During this time, family members are invited to read a passage from an
enlightening book (for example, [The Gospel According to
Spiritism](/books/gospel-according-spiritism)) and share comments and
reflections, often relating the lesson to the events of their current lives.	      	

This is a powerful moment, not only for fortifying the moral and emotional
strengths of the participants, but also for strengthening ties, both among the
individuals and with the good spirits that look after them.


## The Format
Let's learn some guidelines on how to do the Gospel at Home.

### Step 1 - Start with a Complementary reading
Begin with your complementary reading, such as a Spiritist book of inspirational
messages, to help everyone focus on the study you are to begin, leaving aside
other concerns at that time.

### Step 2 - Initial Prayer
Then, someone from the group should say a simple opening prayer, during which
time the the participants should elevate their their thoughts, in order to
connect, mentally, with one another and with the good spirits.

If children are present, you may want to start their reading first, using the
children's books. They should be encouraged to make comments about the reading
and to participate in prayers, as well.
	     	
### Step 3 - Read a passage
You can now begin your reading of a passage from "The Gospel According to
Spiritism".  Participants can take turns reading different pieces of the
passage.  Then, participants can offer comments according to their understanding
of the reading.

### Step 4 - Discuss the passage
They should also try to relate the lesson contained in the reading to the events
of their daily lives.  If you are reading in sequence, you should take note of
the place where you left off to begin there at the next meeting.

### Step 5 - Closing Prayer
End the meeting with a closing prayer, giving thanks for the blessings you have
received, for this moment of study, and for the assistance of the good spirits.
Also, ask for assistance for friends and loved ones, as well as for others who
are in need or who may be suffering.

### Step 6 - Drink the Magnetized water
Distribute the [magnetized water](/en/vocabulary/magnetized-water) among
participants.  The magnetized water is water with powerful spiritual fluids
manipulated by the superior spirits that participated in your metting.

### Step 7 - Keep in Peace
After the meeting, maintain a vibration of inner peace, with elevated thoughts
and conversations.  [Discarnate](/about/discarnate) spirits who may approach a
home to participate in this kind of meeting, may also stay there for some time,
observing each person's behavior.


## Recommended Practices

### Consistency
The meeting needs to be held on the same day, at the same time, each week.  Why?
Because these meetings happen in cooperation with the good spirits.  who make
plans to be present in order to assist both the incarnate participants (us) and
the discarnate spirits who may come to learn with them. 

Occasionally, the meeting may be held at a different time when needed due to
special circumstances.  However, this should happen as little as possible.  If
one or more members is unable to attend on the regular day, the other members
can continue to hold the meeting.  If the whole family is traveling, it is
permissible to do the meeting, wherever they are, if circumstances permit. 

### Duration
The approximate duration of the meeting should be between 30 minutes to one
hour.

It's important to respect the time since our [Spiritual
Guides](/about/spiritual-guide) also have a very busy schedule.

### Environment
The environment should be a place inside the home, where participants feel
comfortable and which allows for the open reading of books. If a household
member is sick at the time, the meeting can be conducted they are, if they would
like. If desired, soft music can be played in the background.  There is no need
for any kind of special decor, candles, or other objects.

The only item you are advised to have on the table, other than your books, is a
pitcher of water to be magnetized, by the good spirits and the elevated thoughts
of prayer, and distributed at the end of the meeting.  If there is someone sick
in the home, a special glass of water should be set out for him or her, to
receive special energies.

### Bibliography
The book to be read should be "The Gospel According to Spiritism"ยน, and as a
complementary reading, you can use a Spiritist book of inspirational messages,
for example, to begin the meeting.  "The Gospel According to Spiritism" can be
read by opening the book at random or in sequence, the latter being advised for
those who do not presently participate in any other orderly/systematic study of
the Spiritism.  Spiritist books for children can also be included if children
are present.

### Preparation
Especially on the day of the meeting, participants should seek to maintain
physical, emotional, and spiritual equilibrium, avoiding alcoholic drinks, heavy
foods, mental exhaustion, arguments, and inappropriate behaviors. They should
turn to the serenity of prayer and be vigilantly observant of their attitudes,
in order to maintain the spiritual strength that this requires.


## Why practice the Gospel at Home
It's important to understand why practice the Gospel at home.

### During the Meeting
Once the meeting begins, it should not be interrupted for phone calls or other
activities.  If someone arrives late, they can be invited to join the group.

### Moral And Spiritual Fortitude
The ethical teachings that are found within "The Gospel According to Spiritism" invite participants to pursue a conscious effort toward inner reform. The educational and inspirational lessons raise their awareness of their own moral strengths and weaknesses and encourage them to resist the negative tendencies that their spirits retain from previous lives, while instead making choices that reflect the more virtuous ideals with which they now they aspire to live.  In addition, when they encounter difficult moments in their lives, and thus find it harder to keep a positive attitude and maintain higher ethical standards, the lessons of the Gospel, when carried in their heart, will serve as a reminder and inspiration to make the extra effort necessary to follow those teachings that they studied during these Gospel At Home meetings and other moments of spiritist study.
	     	
### Strengthened Bond between Family/Household Members
Sharing this kind of experience and these moments of reflection helps the individuals to keep in touch with one another and to understand each other's perspectives, ideas, beliefs, etc. This helps them to cultivate understanding attitudes toward one another and strengthens the bonds of their relationships.

### Purification of the Home with Elevated Thoughts
The quality and nature of the energies that we emit are directly related to the quality of thoughts that we entertain.  When the members of a household join together to reflect upon the moral teachings of Spiritism, their thoughts are raised to a higher frequency, and they will, consequently, emit strong currents of positive, purifying energies which will replace those polluted by any negative or immoral thoughts entertained by family members during the previous week.  This works to restore the fluidic hygiene of the environment and to facilitate the work of the good spirits.

### Company and Assistance of Good Spirits
When we dedicate ourselves to morally edifying study and put into practice the lessons that educate our ethical character, thereby learning to concern ourselves with the well-being of others and the construction of harmonious relationships, we attract good spirits who observe our efforts and desire to help us to be successful. When participants work together to assist one another and to build a strong foundation of support, love, and understanding, the results are magnified.  The spirits that are called to their aid then work in favor of the family as a whole, guiding them with positive intuitions and helping to keep harmonious energies in the home.  These spirits, when present in the home for the Gospel At Home meetings, also help by working to cleanse the fluidic environment (energy) in the home and to magnetize the water that is set out before the meeting, impregnating the spiritual fluids of the water with healthy and fortifying energies.

### Education of Discarnate Spirits
With the regular practice of Gospel At Home meetings, the family members may begin to host an audience of discarnate spirits who will also be present during the meeting to learn from the readings and discussions. These are spirits in need of
