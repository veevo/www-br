Veevo.org is an independent, privacy-focused, completely volunteered developed and run organization. We don't host ads neither get any financial benefit from this site.

Reading about our pillars so you understand better how we think.

## Spiritism
Our first, and most important pillar is [Spiritism](/spiritism): [Jesus](/about/jesus)'s legacy to the [regeneration](/spiritism/worlds/regeneration) of the humanity.

Spiritism is not someone's work. It's the doctrine of the Spirits. It's [the Comforter promissed by Jesus](/messages/jesus/the-consoler) whose mission is to revive His Doctrine so much misinterpreted, distorted, misunderstood and ignored by the humanity for over 2000 years.

Through Spiritism, tousands of books and uncountable reliable communications are happening every day talking humanity, science, philosophy, moral and religion.

We also expect that all content in this site adheres to [Spiritim Teachings](/spiritism/teachings). If not, please [report an error](/report-error).

## Education
Our second pillar is Education. We not only believe Education is a strong foundation to erradicate a lot of the [issues the world faces today](/issues) but is also a fundamentatal tool for self-awereness and moral development.

Education is also very important tool, as recommended by [The Spirit of Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth) on [Evangelho segundo Espiritismo, Capítulo VI - Item 5](/books/allan-kardec/gospel-according-spiritism/5-5):
> Espíritas! amai-vos, este o primeiro ensinamento; instruí-vos, este o segundo. No Cristianismo encontram-se todas as verdades; são de origem humana os erros que nele se enraizaram. Eis que do além-túmulo, que julgáveis o nada, vozes vos clamam: “Irmãos! nada perece. Jesus Cristo é o vencedor do mal, sede os vencedores da impiedade.”

## Openness
Everything that we do should be open to the public for inspection, adaptation and improvement. Nothing should be hidden. We [expose our code online](https://github.com/veevo), provide an open channel for [contribution](/contribute), [communication](/contact) and [error reporting](/report-error).

We are also open to responding to [questions](/questions) and accepting requests of [articles](/articles). All for the benefit of the community.

## Collaboration
We believe that Collaboration is a strong tool to grow, share and learn. In fact, we follow the Spirits teachings who collaborated to build Spiritism and still collaborate today with us all the time. We also strongly believe that any person is allowed collaborate so everyone else benefits. Examples of how you could collaborate are: submitting translations, sharing, recommending articles, asking a question and event reporting and/or fixing errors.

## No Profit
We don't host ads, we don't get any financial benefit from this site and we will never will. Veevo.org follows the [superior spirit's](/about/superior-spirits) teachings that no one should charge for this knowledge and that we should help each other without any secondary intention.

If ever, we kindly ask our readers to volunteer in [Spiritist Centers](/spiritism/centers), divulging Spiritism or working on a local charity. Check the [Charity - Virtue](/virtues/charity) page for more information on how we understand charity and how it is different from the materialist aspect of simply donating money.
