## Introduction
Veevo.org is an independent, privacy-focused, completely volunteered developed and run organization. We don't host ads. We don't benefit financially from this site and we never will.

Our mission is different: we expect to provide light to the human being through the teachings of [Spiritism](/spiritism).

Spiritism is not someone's work. It's the doctrine of the Spirits. It's [the Comforter promissed by Jesus](/messages/jesus/the-consoler) whose mission is to revive Jesus' Doctrine - the Gospel - so much misinterpreted, distorted, misunderstood and ignored by the humanity for over 2000 years.

## Content
We strongly believe in [Education](/pillars/education). While we build some content ourselves, we also publish content from other authors on this site. For content not authored by us, we strive to provide the original source, author name, access date and additional information when applicable. Errors and copyright infringements can be reported using the report feature available on this site. For more information, please also check the _Errors_ and _Removal of Content_ sections for more details.

## Translations
Our mission is to divulge Spiritism to as many people as possible _in the world_. That means translating content to and from different languages. Due to the massive size of our database and to the small size of the team, we often recur to automated translation. While we revise every content before publishing, errors may still occurr. Our [Openness](/pillars/openness) pillar guarantees that readers should be able to report and/or fix errors when applicable.

## Privacy
We are an independent, privacy-focused, completely volunteered developed and run organization. We don't host ads neither benefit financially from this site. Being a [zero-profit organization](/pillars/no-profit) provides a solid foundation to reach our goals and respect your privacy. Due to its simplicity, our website restricts to the minium, the dependencies on third-party vendors so that your privacy is respected to the most. Also, our very low codebase  reduces online risks to our readers.

We also don't store any information. All communication is private and will never be divulged.

## Tracking
We don't use tracking cookies and will never do so. However, we use certain services from companies like GitHub, Twitter and Google that may have different policies. If you care about your privacy, feel free to use an ad blocker if it is of your preference.

## Downloadable Content
We strive to only link to free downloadable material. Since most of the content available trought this site was dictated by [superior Spirits](/about/espirito-superior) or made by [Mediums](/about/medium) who neither impose rigids copyrights nor benefit financially from that work, we openly distribute them for free. For copyright infringiments, please check the _Removal of Content_ section to know how to proceed.

The stated above also applies to videos posted on this site. All links point to videos hosted on public video platforms (YouTube et al). In case any of that content is copyrighted, please contact the owner directly on that channel. In dout, don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact) for questions.

## Errors
While every published content is reviewed and validated against the [Spiritist Doctrine](/spiritism), sometimes we make mistakes. If you spot one, feel free to report it to us using one of the channels available to do so.

## Removal of Content
In case any of the published content violates any copyright, feel free to [contact us](/contact) and we will be happy to remove.

## Response Time
[Openness](/pillars/openness), another pillar of Veevo.org also implies that we should reply inquiries as fast as possible. While we do our best efforts to respond as fast as possible, please note that delays may occur. We will try to respond to very request submitted to us.
