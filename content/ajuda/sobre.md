Veevo.org is an independent, privacy-focused, completely volunteered developed and run organization. We don't host ads, we don't get any financial benefit and we will never will.
We believe that being a [zero-profit organization](/pillars/zero-profit) provides a solid foundation to reach our goals.

## Our Mission
Our mission is different: we expect to provide light to the human being through the teachings of [Spiritism](/spiritism).

## What is Spiritism and why we think it is different
Spiritism is not someone's work. It's the doctrine of the Spirits. It's [the Comforter promissed by Jesus](/messages/jesus/John-14-15).
Spiritism's mission is to revive Jesus' Doctrine so much misinterpreted, distorted, misunderstood and ignored by the humanity for over 2000 years.

## Where does the name Veevo.org come from?
Veevo, as pronounced in English has the same phonetic as *"vivo"* in the [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language) which means **"alive"**.
**"Alive"** perfectly represents our essential nature: immortal spirits. For a immortal spirit there's no death, just life.

## What are our Pillars?
Our [pillars](/pillars) are:
* [Spiritism](/pillars/spiritism): Our first, main and immutable pillar is Spiritism - [Jesus](/about/jesus)'s legacy to the [regeneration](/spiritism/worlds/regeneration) of the humanity.
* [Education](/pillars/education): Our second pillar, education, is only preceeded by [love one another](/messages/jesus/love-one-another) as taught by [The Spirit of Truth](/about/spirit-of-truth) on ESE, Capt5 - 5 "amai-vos, este o primeiro ensinamento; instru√≠-vos, este o segundo".
* [Openness](/pillars/openness): everything that we do should be open to the public for inspection, adaptation and improvement.
* [Community](/pillars/community): we believe that any person can collaborate trough their experiences so everyone else benefits.
* [Zero Profit](/pillars/zero-profit): We don't host ads, we don't get any financial benefit and we will never will.

## Content
